</div>

<p>As Phronsie Pepper was the only one of the
“Five Little Peppers” who had not a chance to
become “grown-up” in the three books that
form the Pepper Library, it seemed (to judge by
the expressions of those persons interested in
this family) a little unfair not to give her that
opportunity.</p>

<p>The author has had so many letters from the
elders, as well as the children, presenting this
view of the case, that she has been brought over
to that opinion herself. And as Phronsie appeared
to have something to say on her own
account, that the public, ever kind and attentive
to the Peppers, desired to hear, it was thought
best to let her speak, to make her appearance
as “grown-up,” and then to draw the curtain
over the “little brown house” and the “Five
Little Peppers,” never more to rise.</p>

<p>Nothing was farther from the mind of the author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
of the “Five Little Peppers” than a series
concerning them; for she did not naturally incline
to the extension of a book into other volumes.
But the portrayal of the lives of the
Peppers seemed to be a necessity. They were
living, breathing realities to her; and when
pressed by many importunate readers to know
“more and more” about “Mamsie and Polly,
Ben, Joel, David, and Phronsie,” it was only like
telling the stories in the twilight hour, of what
was so real and vital to their author, that it was
as if she were not speaking, but only the scribe
to jot it all down as it fell from the lips and
the lives of others.</p>

<p>And here let the author state, in answer to the
question so often asked her, “Did the Peppers
<i>really</i> live? and <i>was</i> there any little brown house?”
that the whole story is imaginative, existing only
in her mind; although they always seemed so alive
to her, that she let them talk and move and act
from beginning to end without let or hindrance;
believing that Margaret Sidney’s part was to
simply set down what the Peppers did and said,
without trying to make them do or say anything
in particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>And now the closing volume, that shuts the
door of the little brown house forever, takes the
whole scene back to dear old Badgertown; and
life begins over again in rollicking, merry, and
home-y fashion; and the “Five Little Peppers,”
with their troops of friends old and young, control
the book, and say and do and live, just as
they like, without the meddlesome intervention of</p>

<small>THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">“O CHILDREN!” said Phronsie softly, “what
are you doing?”</p>

<p>“They’re pulling all the hair out of my mamsie’s
cushion,” shouted King-Fisher, in a tone of
anger; and, struggling with the two delinquents
on the floor, he bestowed several smart pulls on
the chubby shoulders bent over their task.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” cried Phronsie, dropping needle and
scissors, and the little sheer lawn bit destined to
adorn Mamsie’s head, the lace trailing off by itself
across the old kitchen floor, as she sprang to her
feet. “How can you, King?”</p>

<p>“Stop pulling all the hair out of my Mamsie’s
cushion, Barby,” screamed King-Fisher, very red
in the face. “Look at that, now! I’ll bite you,
if you don’t stop!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“O King!” Phronsie seized his arm, as he
began to set his white teeth on the little fat
arm.</p>

<p>Barby sat still in the middle of the floor, both
hands grasped tightly around the old calico cushion,
which she huddled close to her small bosom.
“Go ’way!” she commanded, her blue eyes flashing
at him from her tangle of brown hair. “Go right
’way, bad, naughty boy!”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of him. There, now, see if you
come biting round here, Mister King!” The other
figure deserted the old hair cushion pulled out of
the rocking-chair, and, throwing itself on the unsuspecting
King, rolled over and over, pommelling
and puffing furiously.</p>

<p>“O children, children!” cried Phronsie in great
dismay. Just then the door opened, and in walked
old Mr. King, bending his handsome white head to
clear the doorway.</p>

<p>“Well—well—well! this is beautiful upon my
word!” Then he burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“O Grandpapa!” exclaimed Phronsie, clasping
her hands in distress, “this is so very dreadful!
Do make them stop!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Let them alone,” said the old gentleman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
in the midst of his laugh. “I don’t doubt
King-Fisher has been putting on airs, and Polly’s
boy is aching to take it out of him. That’s right,
Elyot, give it to him! I dare say he deserves
it all, every bit.”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” begged Phronsie, hurrying up
to clasp his arm entreatingly, “do please make
them stop. They’re in the little brown house,
Grandpapa; only just think, the little brown
house. <i>Please</i> make them stop!”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said old Mr. King, pulling himself
out of his amusement, and wiping his face,
“that is a consideration. Come, now, boys, hold
up there; you must finish all this out-of-doors,
if you’ve got to.”</p>

<p>“O Grandpapa!” interposed Phronsie, “please
tell them not to finish at all. Make them stop
always.”</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate, you must stop now, this
minute; do you hear?” He stamped his shapely
foot, and the combatants ceased instantly, King,
in the sudden pause, finding himself at last on
top.</p>

<p>“I could have beaten him all to nothing,” he
declared, puffing violently; “but he jumped whack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
on me, and my arm got twisted under, and—and”—</p>

<p>“Never mind the rest of it,” said Grandpapa
coolly; “of course you’d have beaten if you could.
Well, Elyot, you did pretty good for a boy of
five.”</p>

<p>“He was biting my sister,” declared Elyot,
squaring up, with flushed cheeks, and clinching
his small fists.</p>

<p>“Oh—oh!” cried Barby, who had held her
breath in delighted silence while the encounter
was in progress; and running up, her brown hair
flying away from her face, she presented a fat
arm for the old gentleman’s inspection.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any bite,” he said, after a grave
scrutiny of it all over.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Barby, shaking her brown
head wisely; “but it was coming—it truly was,
Grandpapa.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry till your miseries do come, little
woman;” he swung her up over his white
head, then put her on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“There Phronsie used to perch,” he said, smiling
over at the young girl.</p>

<p>“O Grandpapa, she’s too big—why, she’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Aunt Phronsie, and she’s most dreadful old,”
said Barby, leaning over to look at him.</p>

<p>“Well, she used to sit just where you are,
Miss,” repeated the old gentleman. “Now, you
be sure you’re always number two.” He pinched
her toes, making her squirm and squeal.</p>

<p>“What’s numtwo?” she asked at length, all
out of breath from play.</p>

<p>“Lucky you don’t know,” said the old gentleman,
his mouth close to her ear; “well, it’s
just always after number one, and never gets in
front. There, now, jump down, and help Phronsie
patch it up with the boys.” He put her on
the floor, and went over to the corner, to sit
down and view operations.</p>

<p>Phronsie, meanwhile, had a boy each side of
her, both trying to get into her lap at once.</p>

<p>“It would just kill Mamsie,” she said mournfully,
“to think of you two boys behaving so,
and she’s only gone a week!”</p>

<p>There was an awful pause. The old gentleman
over in the corner kept perfectly still; and
Barby, finding all obstructions removed, placidly
engaged in completing the destruction of Mother
Fisher’s cushion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“And you promised her, King, you’d be a good
boy, and be nice to the children.”</p>

<p>“I—forgot,” blurted out King, winking very
fast, and not looking at Elyot. “I—I—did.
Don’t look so, Phronsie,” he mumbled; and instantly
after his head went over in his sister’s
lap, and he sobbed in her dress, “Don’t write
her, Phronsie—don’t!”</p>

<p>“And to think,” said Phronsie, gravely regarding
Elyot, “that you should fly at him, when he
only wanted to protect Mamsie’s dear old cushion.
O Elyot! I am so surprised at you for
pulling it to pieces.”</p>

<p>“I only wanted to see inside it; you said
Mamsie and Uncle Ben made a Santa Claus wig
of it once; I was going to put it right back,”
said Elyot stoutly. Yet he looked at the ceiling
diagonally, not trusting himself a glance into
Phronsie’s brown eyes. “Say, you don’t suppose
Grandmamsie will know?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“I suppose I must tell Mamsie everything,”
said Phronsie soberly. “I promised to, you
know. And, besides, we always have.”</p>

<p>Elyot shivered all over his small frame, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
King howled, and burrowed deeper than ever in
Phronsie’s lap.</p>

<p>“But I can tell her how sorry you two boys
are,” Phronsie went on, “and that you never,
never will do such a naughty thing again; that
is, if you never will, boys.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p015">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p015.jpg" alt="There! I got it all out alone by myself">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“There! I got it all out alone by myself,” said Barby.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Oh, we never will!” they both protested over
and over; and King came up out of his shelter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and wiped his eyes, and the two put their arms
around each other, and made up splendidly;
then turned to hear Barby say, “There, I got
it all out alone by myself;” and there was the
hair out of Mamsie’s cushion all sprawled over
the floor.</p>

<p>While the children were picking this up, and
crowding it back into the big calico cover,
Phronsie making Elyot do the best part of the
work, as he was older, and had helped Barby
along, King working vigorously, as penance, old
Mr. King called, “Now, Phronsie, I want you,
as those youngsters seem to be straightened
out;” and she had gone and sat on his knee,
her usual place in a conference.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve just done such a good stroke
of work, child,” he said complacently, pulling
softly the golden waves of hair that lay over
her cheek.</p>

<p>“What, Grandpapa?” she asked, as he seemed
to wait her reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, such a good piece of work,” he ran on.
Then he chuckled, well pleased. “You must
know, Phronsie,” for he was determined to tell
it in a way to suit himself, “that I was sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
on the back veranda—Polly’s gone to town
to-day, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpapa.”</p>

<p>“Well, and the house was quiet, thanks to
you and the little brown house, and I had a
chance to read the morning paper in peace.”
This he said, unconscious of the fact that every
one knew quite well he courted the presence of
the children on any and every occasion. “Well,
I had considerable to read; the news, strange to
say, is very good, really very good to-day, so
it took me quite a long time.” He forgot to
mention that he had lost himself a half-hour
or so in a nap; these occurrences were never
to be commented on in the family. “And I
was turning the paper—it’s abominable that
editors mix things up so; it’s eternally turning
and returning the sheet, to find what you want.
It’s very hard, Phronsie, when we pay such
prices for articles, that we cannot have them to
suit us, child.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpapa,” said Phronsie patiently.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t look at those youngsters,
Phronsie; they’re all right now. They won’t
fight any more to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“O Grandpapa!”</p>

<p>“I mean it, child. Well, I was turning that
contemptible paper for about the fiftieth time,—I
wanted to read Brinkerhoff’s editorial,—when
I caught sight of a figure making around the
lawn to the front veranda. Thinks I, ‘that
looks wonderfully like Roslyn May.’”</p>

<p>The pink glow in Phronsie’s round cheek went
suddenly out.</p>

<p>“And so it was, as sure as you’re here on my
knee.” He had her hand in both of his, and was
affectionately pressing it. “Yes, Phronsie, there
was that fellow. So I jumped up, and told Johnson
to send him around to me; and he came.”</p>

<p>Old Mr. King drew a long breath of pleased
reminiscence. Phronsie sat quite still, the afternoon
sunlight that streamed through the western
window glinting her yellow hair. Her hands
lay in Grandpapa’s, and her eyes never wavered
from his face. But she said nothing.</p>

<p>“You don’t ask me anything, Phronsie,” said
the old gentleman at last. “Hey, child?” pinching
her ear.</p>

<p>“No, Grandpapa, because you will tell me yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“And so I will; you are a good girl not to
badger me with questions. Well, he came about
the same thing, Phronsie,—wanted to see you,
and all that. But I couldn’t allow it, of course;
for, if I did, the next thing, you would be worried
to death by his teasing. And that’s all
out of the question. Besides being decidedly unpleasant
for you, it would kill me.”</p>

<p>“Would it, Grandpapa?” Phronsie leaned forward
suddenly, and held him with her brown
eyes.</p>

<p>“Not a shadow of doubt,” he answered promptly;
“I shouldn’t live a month if you went off
and got married, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go off and get married, Grandpapa!”
exclaimed Phronsie. “I could stay with
you then; didn’t Roslyn say we could, and you
would always go with us if we went away? O
Grandpapa, you didn’t think I would ever leave
you!” She threw her arms around his neck, and
clung to him convulsively.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said the old gentleman,
immensely pleased, and patting her on the back
as if she were a child of three; “but you see
this is nothing to the point, Phronsie, nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
at all.” Then he went on testily, “You’d belong
to somebody else besides me, and that would be
the same as being a thousand miles away. And
as long as I’m sure you don’t love him, Phronsie,”—which
he had found out by taking care
not to ask her,—“why, I’ve done just the very
best thing for you, to send him away about his
business.”</p>

<p>“Did he ask to see me?” Phronsie sat up
quite straight now, and waited quietly for the
answer.</p>

<p>“Why, of course he did; but I knew it would
only trouble you to see him.”</p>

<p>“O Grandpapa—just one little minute—I
wouldn’t have let him stay long. Couldn’t you
have sent him over here just for one minute?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You’re so tender of his feelings,
it would only have been hard for you. No, I
thank my stars, Phronsie, I saved you from all
this trouble. What you would do, child, if it
were not for your old Granddaddy, I’m sure I
don’t know. Well, he’s gone, and I told him
never to come back again with that errand in
view; and I only hope to goodness it’s the last
time I shall be so worried by him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“There, we’ve got the hair all in,” announced
King triumphantly, rushing up, followed by the
other two, Barby wiping her grimy little hands
in great satisfaction over her white apron. “Now
please say we’ve been good boys, and”—</p>

<p>“And a good girl,” chimed in Barby, flying
after with red cheeks.</p>

<p>“And sew up the old cushion,” begged Elyot.
This would be almost as good fun as the pulling
it open had been, to see Phronsie sewing it tight,
and she could tell them stories meanwhile.</p>

<p>“Let the cushion wait,” began Mr. King.</p>

<p>“But, Grandpapa, the hair may get spilled out
again,” said Phronsie gently, and getting off from
his knee. “I really think I ought to do it now,
Grandpapa dear.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” cried all the children, hopping up
and down; “do it now—do it now, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>So Phronsie found her thimble and scissors
once more, and got out the coarse brown thread
from her little sewing-bag, and sewed the big
seam in the old calico cushion fast again, the
children taking turns in poking the wisps of hair
in the crevice.</p>

<p>“Now tell all what you used to do when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
lived here—just here,” demanded Elyot, patting
the old floor with his hand, “every single thing,
Phronsie;” for the children, except on rare occasions,
never called her “Aunt.” “Don’t leave
out anything you did in the little brown house.
Now begin.”</p>

<p>“O Elyot,” said Phronsie, “I couldn’t tell it
all if I tried ever so hard.”</p>

<p>“Polly tells the best stories,” said King, pushing
and picking the hair into place in the last
corner.</p>

<p>“So she does,” said Phronsie; “there now,
King-Fisher, that’s all you can do. Look out; my
needle is coming up there,” as King with a final
pull settled the last little wisp into place.</p>

<p>“Let me—let me,” begged Barby, thrusting
her little hand in. “I want to do it last. Let
me, King.”</p>

<p>“No,” said King stoutly, hanging to the corner.
“I shall; it’s my mother’s cushion.”</p>

<p>“O King,” began Phronsie gently, “Mamsie
would like it better if you let Barby do it. She’s
so little.”</p>

<p>“She’s always pushing, just the same,” said
King stoutly, “as if she was big folks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Well, if you want to please Mamsie, you’ll
let her do it,” went on Phronsie, pausing with
needle in mid-air. “Hurry, now, children; I can’t
wait any longer.”</p>

<p>“You may, Barby,” declared King, relinquishing
with a mighty effort the pinched-up corner.
“There, go ahead,” and he winked fast at her
great satisfaction while she pushed and poked the
wisps in with her fat little finger, humming contentedly
meanwhile.</p>

<p>Phronsie flashed a smile over at King. “Now,
children,” she said, “you must know we were
very poor in those days, and”—</p>

<p>“What is poor?” asked Barby, stopping singing.</p>

<p>“I know,” said Elyot; “it’s wearing rags like
the ashman. Oh, I wish I could!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried Phronsie in horror; “that isn’t
poor; that’s shiftless, Mamsie always used to
say. Oh, we were just as nice! Well, you can’t
think, children, how spick and span everything
was!”</p>

<p>“What’s spick ’n’ span?” demanded Barby.</p>

<p>“Make her stop,” cried Elyot crossly; “we shall
never hear all about it if she keeps asking questions
every minute. Now go on, Phronsie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Well,” said Phronsie, “now that corner’s all
done beautifully, Barby; take care, or I shall
prick your finger. Why, Polly would scrub and
scrub the floor and the table, till I used to try
to see my face in them, they were so bright.”</p>

<p>“They’re bright now,” declared both the boys,
jumping off to investigate. Barby pushed her
hair back from her round cheeks, and leaned
over. “I don’t see my face, Phronsie,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, and I couldn’t see mine; but I always
tried to, for Polly kept them so bright, and one
day I remember I was scrubbing Seraphina,
and”—</p>

<p>“Who’s Seraphina?” burst in Barby, coming
back to crouch at Phronsie’s feet.</p>

<p>“Ow! Be still!” cried Elyot, with a small
pinch.</p>

<p>“Seraphina was my very first doll, the only
child I ever had until Grandpapa gave me all
the rest,” Phronsie sent a smile over to the old
gentleman in the corner, “and she’s in Mamsie’s
big bureau in the bedroom now.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see,” declared all three children
at once, hopping up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Oh, no! you mustn’t,” said Phronsie; “not
till this cushion is done. Then, if you’re very
good, I’ll show her to you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be just as good,” they all cried, “as
we can be,” and running back to sit down on
the floor again at her feet. “Do go on,” said
Elyot.</p>

<p>“You see, I wanted Seraphina to be just as
nice as Polly kept things; and so I was scrubbing
her with soap and water one day, when
Polly called out, ‘O Phronsie! the big dog’s out
here that scared the naughty organ-man; and the
boy;’ and before she could wipe my hands and
my face, for you see I’d got the soap all over
me too, I ran to see them, and Jasper kissed
me, and got the soft soap all in his mouth.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” cried King, with a grimace.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s just the way Japser looked, and
that’s what he said too!” said Phronsie, going on
with the recital.</p>

<p>“Who was Japser?” demanded Barby.</p>

<p>“Why, he was our Popsie,” said Elyot, who had
heard the story many times. “Now do stop talking,
Barby. Well, go on,” he begged, turning
back to Phronsie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“And I couldn’t say Jasper,” said Phronsie,
“and then sometimes we called him Jappy.”</p>

</figure>

<p>“How funny!” laughed all three. “Oh, goody!
here comes Mr. Tisbett,” howled King in a sudden
rapture, lifting his head to see the top of the
old stage through the window. “Why, he’s stopping
here! He’s stopping here!” and, tumbling
over the other two, King found his feet, and
pranced off over the big flat doorstone, and down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the path, Elyot and Barby flying after, to see
Mr. Tisbett open the stage-door with a, “Here
you be, ma’am, and the boy too.”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” cried Phronsie, taking one look
out of the window, “it’s Mrs. Fargo and Johnny!”</p>

<p>“The mercy it is!” exclaimed the old gentleman
ruefully. “Well, good-by, Phronsie, to any
sort of peace, now that boy’s come!”</p>

<small>A BADGERTOWN EVENING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“BOOKS! I’ve a fine packet for you to-night,
Polly.” Jasper’s eyes glowed.
Polly ran up to meet him.</p>

<p>“O Mamsie! let me take the books—let
me!” Elyot thrust in his small figure between
them, and tugged at the parcel.</p>

<p>“You take yourself off, young man,” said his
father. “Now, Polly, hold out your arms.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what richness!” sighed Polly ecstatically,
“as Alexia would say;” and, clasping her
parcel closely, she sank into a big chair, and
examined her treasure. “O Jasper!” she cried,
“isn’t it just magnificent to be a publisher’s
wife!”</p>

<p>Jasper laughed, and swung his boy up to his
broad shoulder.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d like them, Polly,” he said
with great satisfaction, looking at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Like them!” repeated Polly in a glow.
Then she sprang to her feet, tossed the whole
pile into the easy-chair, and ran up to her husband,
putting her hand within his arm. “But
where is the bag, Jasper?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Oh, what richness!” sighed Polly.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Well, the fact of it is, Polly,” said Jasper
slowly, “I left the bag at the office. Just for
this night,” he added, as he saw her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Why, Jasper?” asked Polly quickly, the
color dropping out of her cheek.</p>

<p>“Well, the truth is, I was afraid,” began
Jasper.</p>

<p>“Oh! go on, and dance me up and down,
Daddy,” screamed Elyot, beating his heels with
all his might.</p>

<p>Polly laid her hand on the small feet. “No,
no, dear; Mamsie’s going to talk now. Why,
Jasper?” she asked again. This time she stood
quite still, and looked at him.</p>

<p>Jasper swung his boy lightly to the ground.
“Off with you!” he cried with a laugh, and Elyot
scuttled away. “Now, Polly,” as he put his
arm around her, and drew her to a seat, “the
fact is, I thought you wouldn’t sit down and go
over those books to-night if I brought out the
bag.”</p>

<p>“And so I wouldn’t,” declared Polly. “Of
course not, with the dear old bag waiting. How
could I?”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Jasper; “and it’s not fair
for me to bring the bag, with those waiting,
either;” he nodded over at the untied packet and
the new books scattered about. “You ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
have at least one go at them before being tied
down to business matters.”</p>

<p>Polly broke loose from him, and ran over to
the easy-chair. “And did you think I would so
much as look at these once?” she cried, her face
flushing up to the brown waves. “Oh! oh! I
just detest them now.” She looked down at the
pile with the same face that she carried in the
little brown house when the old stove burned
Mamsie’s birthday cake.</p>

<p>“But, Polly,” said Jasper, hurrying over to
comfort her, “you see it’s just this way. I’m
tying you down too much to business detail, and
you ought to be enjoying yourself more, dear.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you suppose, Jasper,” cried Polly,
turning on his troubled face a radiant one, “that
lovely old bag is just the dearest dear in all the
world next to you and the children? Oh, say
you will never leave it again! Do say so, Jasper;”
she clung to him.</p>

<p>“I am so afraid I’m making your life too full
of care, Polly,” said Jasper gravely, “to bring
the bag out every night. And this evening we
might go over the new books, and have a break
in the routine for once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“And let you work over all your papers alone,
Jasper,” cried Polly, aghast. “O Jasper!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe18_75" id="illus_p032">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p032.jpg" alt="Dance me up and down, daddy!">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Dance me up and down, daddy!” screamed Elyot.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I can find time to do them, dear; don’t worry.
And it would be better for you.”</p>

<p>“And indeed it would be the worst thing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
all this world, dear,” protested Polly, shaking
her brown head. “I should be so dismal, Jasper,
you can’t think, without our lovely time
working together after dinner. When the bag is
done, then we’ll play and read, and do all sorts
of things. But that first hour is the best of the
whole evening, Jasper; it truly is.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I love it,” cried Jasper, with kindling
eyes; “I never could do it so well without
you, nor in half the time, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Well, then you must just promise you’ll
never leave the bag back in the office,” said
Polly, laughing. “Promise now, Jasper.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I must,” said Jasper, laughing too.
“Here come Alexia and Pickering,” looking down
the carriage-drive.</p>

<p>“We’ve come out to dinner, Polly, if you want
us,” said Alexia, hurrying in, Pickering’s tall figure
following. “Goodness me! how you can live
so far out of town, I don’t see!”</p>

<p>“So you say every time I chance to meet you,
Alexia” said Jasper.</p>

<p>“Yes, and that’s the reason she’s decided to
try it herself,” said Pickering with a drawl.</p>

<p>“O Alexia!” Polly gave her a small hug, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
she helped her off with her things, “are you
really coming to Badgertown? Oh, how nice!”</p>

<p>“Pickering is always springing things on me,
and telling everything I say,” said Alexia, trying
to send a cross grimace over at her husband,
but ending with a short laugh instead, “and
just because I said I wanted to have a house
near you, Polly, he’s got it into his head I’m
coming out here to live.”</p>

<p>Pickering indulged in a long laugh.</p>

<p>“And I think it’s a shame,” declared Alexia,
with a very injured face, “to have one’s husband
go about, and spoil all one’s surprise parties—so
there!”</p>

<p>“Then you really do mean to come to Badgertown
to live, Alexia?” cried Polly with sparkling
eyes. “Oh, you dear! how perfectly delightful!”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ll have to, Polly,” said Alexia,
“as I must be just as near you as I can get.
But I do think Badgertown is utterly horrid, and
you ought to be ashamed to live out here so far.
I’m dying to have that cunning little yellow
house on the hill, Polly,” she broke off suddenly,
“with the barberry-bushes in front, and we’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
come out here to see it after dinner. Now you
know it all; only I was going to ask you to go
out and take a walk, and then bring you up there
with a flourish, and give you a grand surprise.
And now it’s as tame as tame can be.” She
shook her linger at Pickering, who bore it like a
veteran.</p>

<p>“How’s baby?” asked Polly, when the wraps
were off, and they were all seated on the long
veranda for a talk.</p>

<p>“He’s the dearest little rat you ever saw,”
said Alexia, who couldn’t forgive her boy for not
being a girl, whom she could call Polly. “He’s
two teeth, and four more coming.”</p>

<p>“Alexia always counts those teeth that are
coming with so much gusto,” said Pickering.</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t I?” cried Alexia. “It
would be perfectly horrid if he stopped with two
teeth; you know it would yourself, Pickering.
And to-day, Polly Pepper, you can’t think”—</p>

<p>“I decidedly object to having my wife called
Polly Pepper,” said Jasper, trying to get on a
grave look. “Polly Pepper King is all right.
But be sure to put on the King.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we girls shall never call her anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
else but Polly Pepper—never in all this world,
Jasper,” said Alexia carelessly. “Well, you tell
what baby did to-day, Pickering. I’m quite tired
out with all my trial of getting here, and the
disappointment of my surprise spoiled.” She
leaned back in the rattan chair, and played with
her rings.</p>

<p>“Our child,” said Pickering solemnly, “developed
a most astonishing mental power this
morning, and actually uttered two consecutive
syllables like this, ‘Ar-goo!’”</p>

<p>“So did Elyot at the same tender age,” observed
Jasper, “and Barby too, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Now, you just be quiet, Pickering!” Alexia
cried, starting forward; “and aren’t you ashamed,
Jasper, to help him on? Baby actually said the
most beautiful words; he really and truly did.
And that’s what I wanted to come out for to-night,
Polly, as much as to look at the house,
to tell you that baby’s talking; and he’s only
eight months old! Think of that, now!”</p>

<p>“I met Roslyn May down town to-day,” said
Pickering when the laugh had subsided.</p>

<p>“Did you!” exclaimed Jasper.</p>

<p>Polly stopped laughing at one of Alexia’s sallies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and met her husband’s eyes. His look said,
“Strange he did not come out here.”</p>

<p>“Yes; he just got in day before yesterday,
he told me, from England. I couldn’t understand
what he came over for.”</p>

<p>“He is going to stay some time, I suppose,”
said Jasper, “now he’s here.”</p>

<p>“No, he was on the way to the steamer, when
we ran across each other on Broadway,—sailed
to-day on the Cunarder; that is, he said he was
going to.”</p>

<p>“He was going right back!” exclaimed Polly;
and going over to Jasper’s side, she lay her hand
on his. “What do you mean, Pickering?”</p>

<p>“It’s just so, Polly,” said Pickering, feeling
awfully that he must make the sad droop in her
eyes, and the color go out of her face.</p>

<p>“He probably is coming back soon—he may
have been cabled back—a dozen things may
have happened,” said Jasper. “Don’t feel so
badly, dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, Phronsie must never know he has
been over,” said Polly. “Promise, Alexia, you
never’ll tell her! You won’t, dear, will you?”
She ran over and put her arms around Alexia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Horses won’t drag it out of me,” declared
Alexia. “I won’t ever mention Roslyn May
to”—</p>

<p>“Hush!—hush! here she comes,” warned
Polly frantically, pinching Alexia’s arm to make
her stop.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy! Well, I didn’t say anything,”
said Alexia.</p>

<p>Phronsie came around the veranda corner in
her soft white gown. “We’re going to have a
candy party to-night,” she said.</p>

<p>“And a peanut party,” cried the children at
her heels, as they scurried over the veranda
steps. “Tell it all, Phronsie; tell it all.”</p>

<p>“And you’re just in time, Alexia and Pickering,”
said Phronsie, with a smile, “to come
over to the little brown house after dinner, to
the party.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve got to pull candy with me, Mrs.
Dodge,” declared Elyot, who just adored her,
racing up to possess himself of her long white
fingers, glittering with rings.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy me! I can’t. Why, I’ve on my
best dress,” she said, to tease him.</p>

<p>“Mamsie will let you have one of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
aprons,” he cried, “or my nice Mrs. Higby will.
I’ll go and ask her.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to; Mrs. Higby will let me
have the aprons,” shouted Barby, turning her
back on her father, in whose lap she had thrown
herself, and rushing after him.</p>

<p>“We’re all in for it, I see,” said Pickering.
“Well, King, you’re my boy, seeing the others
have got champions. What do you want? I’ll
see you through this candy scrape.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have my brother Jasper,” said
King, not over politely, “but I’ll take you.”</p>

<p>“O King!” remonstrated Phronsie gently.</p>

<p>“Let him alone, Phronsie,” said Pickering.
“King is delicious when unadulterated. Well,
my boy, so I’ll consider myself engaged to you
for this evening at the party.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said King coolly.</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Higby says we can have all the
aprons we want,” announced Elyot, rushing back.</p>

<p>“And she’ll boil the candy while we’re at
dinner,” piped Barby, tumbling after.</p>

<p>“This knocks your pretty plan of gazing at
the yellow house, sky-high, Alexia,” whispered
Pickering, under cover of the noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“No, it doesn’t,” she retorted. “We’ll go afterward,
when the children are abed. It’s moonlight,
and we can see it just as well.”</p>

<p>“Think of choosing a house by moonlight!”
laughed Pickering.</p>

<p>“Just as well as to choose it by sunlight, as
long as we can see,” said Alexia, jingling the
house-key they had secured from the agent on
the way up. “Yes; we’ll have quite time before
we take the train home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t go home to-night!” cried Polly
and Jasper together. “The idea! with a party
and house-hunting on your hands. Stay over,
Alexia.”</p>

<p>“I must be in town at eight in the morning,”
said Pickering, getting out of his chair to stretch
his long legs and look at the hills. “Alexia can
stay if she wants to.”</p>

<p>“As if I could or would, when my husband
can’t,” she cried. “And there’s that blessed
child left all alone!”</p>

<p>“But since he’s learned to converse,” said
Pickering, “he can ask for his rations. So he’s
not to be considered.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m perfectly shocked!” declared Alexia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
“And I shall go home with you in the
late train.”</p>

<p>Oh, the candy frolic of that night! Everybody
had such a glorious time that the little old kitchen
rang with the jollity that flowed over, taking in
all Primrose Lane, and down as far as “Grandma
Bascom’s” little cottage. “Grandma” now
had to lie abed with her rheumatism; but Polly
and Jasper found time to slip away a bit in the
midst of the festivities and carry her a little dish
of the candy before the nuts were put in, for
“Grandma” didn’t like nuts, and she did like
molasses candy. And Polly carried a few other
things in a small basket on her arm.</p>

<p>“For I never shall forget, Jasper,” she said as
they hurried along, “how good Grandma was the
day Phronsie hurt her toe. Oh, that horrible old
‘receet’ of Mirandy’s wedding-cake! I thought
it would kill me to wait for it. Dear, dear,”
laughed Polly, “how we do remember, don’t we,
Jasper, things we used to do when we were children?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I never want to forget what we did
in the little brown house,” said Jasper. “Well,
Grandma was always good, I remember, bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
raisins and all that. Now, Polly, we must tell
her every single bit of Joel’s last letter; for
she’ll question us up just as closely, you may be
sure.”</p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“We’ve come out to dinner, Polly,” said Alexia.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I know it,” said Polly, hanging to his arm;
“and Joel thinks as much of Grandma as she
does of him. It’s so nice of him, Jappy, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed!” said Jasper, nodding briskly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
“for no matter how tired Joe is,—and he must
get awfully used up sometimes, Polly, with that
big parish of his,—he’s always doing something
for her. It was fine for him to buy her that big
easy-chair with the first money he had saved up
after he paid father back for his education.”</p>

<p>“Dear, beautiful old Joel!” cried Polly, with
shining eyes.</p>

<p>“How upset father was,” exclaimed Jasper, in
a reminiscent mood, “when Joe made him take
that money back. I declare, Polly, I never saw
him so upset in all my life!”</p>

<p>“It was right for Joel to make him,” said
Polly stoutly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it. But Father had so set his
mind on doing it for Joe.”</p>

<p>“But Joey couldn’t take it to keep,” declared
Polly. “You know he really couldn’t, Jasper.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Jasper quickly. “But
what we should have done without Phronsie to
make the peace between them, I don’t know.
Well, here we are.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“See here,” cried Alexia, Mrs. Higby’s red
plaid apron working all up her long figure, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
she had tied it by the strings around her neck,
“if somebody doesn’t go over and call Polly
Pepper home, why I’ll just go myself.” She
brandished the big wooden spoon, a few drops
of molasses trailing off over the floor.</p>

<p>“I suppose that is meant for me,” said Pickering,
placidly eating the big piece he ought to
have been pulling, “as I’m the only one she
orders round.”</p>

<p>“Horrors!” cried Alexia, glancing along the
tip of the spoon, “just see the mischief I’ve
done! Now the Peppers won’t ever let me in
this kitchen again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wipe it up,” said Elyot, running over to
her, with sticky hands, and face streaked with
molasses.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Alexia with a grimace, and
edging away. “Oh, my goodness, me! and see
my husband eating candy like a little pig, and
me in this dreadful scrape.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was your husband,” said little Elyot,
getting down on his knees; and, seizing the first
thing he could find, which proved to be a fine
damask napkin, he began to vigorously mop the
floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Mercy me! what have you got?” cried
Alexia, her sharp eyes peering at him. “Oh!
give it to me.” She seized it from his hand,
and threw down the spoon. “Come along, do,”
and she hauled him out into the entry. “It’s one
of Polly Pepper’s bestest napkins; we brought it
over on the cake-plate. Now we must just douse
it into a pail of water; but goodness knows
where that is.”</p>

<p>“Hoh!” said Elyot, “I know where there’s
one, just as easy as not. Come on.”</p>

<p>It was now his turn to haul Alexia, and he
did it so successfully that she was soon over the
little steps, and in the “Provision Room.”</p>

<p>“If ever I’m thankful,” she sighed gratefully,
“it is to see that sticky mess come out,” when
Elyot had delightedly plunged the napkin into a
pail of water standing in the corner. “Oh, my
goodness me! if it had spoiled that; and it’s one
of her great big embroidered K’s, too! Well,
come on; we must run back, or the whole troop
of them will be after us. Wring it out and hang
it up, do! Now come on.”</p>

<p>She picked up her skirts, and skipped over the
steps, Elyot scuttling after, in time to hear Pickering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
say, “Evidently my wife doesn’t intend to
take the train with me, for she’s disappeared.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p046">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p046.jpg" alt="Somebody take off this!">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Somebody take off this!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I haven’t disappeared at all; I’m here,”
cried Alexia at his elbow. “The idea! Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
I’m going to look at the house on the hill; but
’tisn’t time yet,” drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>“Going to look at the house on the hill! Well,
I guess you won’t to-night,” said Pickering, taking
out his watch; “it’s just a quarter of ten,
and the train leaves at ten. So, good-by, Alexia;
you’ve got to stay all night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t—I won’t!” cried Alexia. “Oh,
dear! somebody take off this horrible old apron,”
wildly twisting this way and that.</p>

<p>“I will—I will,” cried little Elyot, fumbling
at the strings.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear—dear!” wailed Alexia, “my face
is all stuck up; somebody—where’s Mrs. Higby?
Oh, somebody wash it, please!” She was rushing
around after her bonnet now, Elyot hanging
to the apron-strings valiantly, this process
tying them tighter than ever at each step.</p>

<p>“Here, hold on, can’t you!” roared Pickering.
“You’ll never get her undone at that rate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will, too,” cried Elyot, tugging away,
and tumbling against Mrs. Higby with a towel,
wet at one end, in her hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear! and that blessed child at
home alone,” cried Alexia. “Mercy! here’s my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
best bonnet down by the coal-scoop. Well, as
long as I’ve got anything to put on my head I
suppose I should be thankful. Oh, dear! where’s
that wet towel? Do cut the strings of this horrible
old apron—Oh, dear! what shall I do!”
She whirled around on them all, as the door
opened, and in ran Polly and Jasper, with glowing
cheeks.</p>

<p>“For goodness sake, Alexia!” began Polly.</p>

<p>“Whew! Is it a menagerie?” cried Jasper.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s bad enough to go visiting, and have
your friends run off to see horrible old women,”
said Alexia, whirling more than ever, “without
coming back to laugh at one’s misery. Oh,
that’s a dear, Mrs. Higby!” as that good lady’s
scissors clicked, and set her free. “I’ll bring
you out a new pair of strings next time I come.
Come on, Pickering—good-by, everybody;” and
she was out and running down the path by the
time he found his hat.</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” and back she came again, “I forgot
my face; it’s all stuck up. Do, somebody,
wash this molasses off.” And Polly gave her a
dab with the wet towel, and a little kiss at the
same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“You didn’t wash it in the right place,” grumbled
Alexia, running off again; “it was the other
cheek. Oh dear, dear! Come on, Pickering;
we shall lose the train.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

<small>JOHNNY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHAT a pity that Johnny couldn’t come to
the candy party,” sighed Phronsie the
next day, looking over at the little brown house
across the lane, which presented the same serene
appearance, as if such jovial affairs had not
been; “but I suppose Mrs. Fargo knew best, and
he really was too tired, as they’d just come.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fargo surely does know best,” said
Polly, stopping long enough in her trial of a
very difficult passage in the sonata to fling this
over her shoulder to Phronsie; “for you know,
Phronsie, Johnny is just awful when he’s tired
out.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I know,” said Phronsie, with another
sigh, “but then he’s Johnny, you know, Polly.”</p>

<p>“And the dearest dear of a Johnny too!”
cried Polly warmly, going on with her practising.
“O Phronsie, supposing I <i>shouldn’t</i> play this—good!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
She stopped suddenly, and leaned both
hands on the music-rest at the dreadful thought.</p>

<p>Phronsie stopped looking over the children’s
books on the table, and, setting them straight,
came over to her side.</p>

<p>“You can’t make a mistake,” she breathed
confidently. “Why, Polly, you play it beautifully!”</p>

<p>“But I may,” broke in Polly recklessly. “Oh,
I may, Phronsie! And then, oh, dear! I could
never hold my head up in all this world. It
would be so very dreadful for Jasper and the
children, for me not to play it as it ought to
be.”</p>

<p>Phronsie leaned over Polly’s shoulder, and put
two soft arms around her neck. “You will
play it good, Polly,” she declared; “and Mamsie
would say,—I know she would,—that you’re
not to think of what you’ll do at the time, till
the time comes.”</p>

<p>“You blessed child!” cried Polly, whirling
around on the music-stool. “O Phronsie! you’re
just such a comfort as you were that day when
Grandpapa brought you and put you in my arms,
when I broke down practising, and I’d almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
made up my mind to go home. Now, then, I’ll
just stop worrying, and play ahead.”</p>

<p>And she sat up straight, and flashed all the brilliant
passages over again, Phronsie standing quite
still to watch Polly’s fingers flying up and down.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding all Phronsie’s comfort,
Polly knew that she would have to give hard
and constant work to make this, the supreme
effort of her life thus far in a musical way, a
success. It was the first time that anybody outside
of the highest professional lines had been
asked to play with the Symphony Orchestra; and
when this urgent request had been laid before
Polly, she had said, “Oh, no! I cannot play well
enough.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Jasper King’s reputation as a pianist
had gone farther than Polly knew. A request
came, signed by a long list of people whose names
were high in an artistic sense, fortified by the
best citizens of the good old town of Berton,—itself
a guaranty of anything in that line, for
was it not the home of the Symphony? When
this came, and Polly saw Jasper’s eyes, she gave
a little gasp. “I will, dear, if you think best,”
she said, looking at no one but him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“It’s just as you say, Polly,” Jasper had
answered. But his eyes shone, and he instinctively
straightened up with pride. And when
she had said, “O Jasper! if you think I can, I’ll
do it,”—“I know you can, Polly,” Jasper had
declared, and Polly had said “Yes,” and great
delight reigned everywhere; and Grandpapa had
patted her head, and said, “Well done, Polly!
To think of all those hard hours of practice in
the old days turning out like this;” and Mamsie
had smiled at her in a way that only Mamsie
could smile. And Polly and Jasper had hurried
off to Berton the next morning, Jasper
swinging the little publishing bag, on the way to
the train, with a jubilant hand; and in the lapse
of the hard working hours, when things eased
up a bit, he had said to Mr. Marlowe (for it
was Marlowe &amp; King now, in bright gilt letters
over the big door), “I am going with my wife
to select the music,” for Polly was a prime favorite
with Mr. Marlowe, and everything was told
to him.</p>

<p>And Jasper and Polly went to the music-store,
and ransacked the shelves, and tried various selections,
for Polly was to play what she liked;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and after the piece was picked out, then the two
went to luncheon at the cunning little restaurant
on a side street, nice and quiet, where they could
talk it all over.</p>

<p>But sometimes, when Polly was all alone in the
big music-room opening on the side veranda, she
trembled all over at the terrible responsibility
she had taken upon herself. It seemed so very
much worse to fail now that she bore Jasper’s
honored name, than if she were only unknown
and simple “Polly Pepper.” And to-day she
could not help showing this dismay to Phronsie.</p>

<p>“But Mamsie would say so,” repeated Polly
over and over to herself bravely, “just what
Phronsie did.” And then at it she would fly
harder than ever. And every evening after the
“publishing bag” had been looked over in Jasper’s
and Polly’s little den, and its contents
sorted and attended to for the morrow, Jasper
would always say, “Now, Polly, for the music;”
and Polly would fly to the piano, while he drew
up a big easy-chair to her side, to settle into it
restfully; and the others would hurry in at the
first note, and then Polly’s concert would begin.
And every night she knew she played it a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
bit better, and her cheeks glowed, and her heart
took comfort.</p>

<p class="caption">Tying on her big garden hat, Phronsie went across the road.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Phronsie put away the little sewing-bag as
soon as Polly finished practising this morning,
and hung it on its hook over Grandpapa’s newspaper
rack,—for she always sat and sewed in
the music-room mornings when Polly practised,
generally making sails for the boys, just as Polly
had done years ago, or clothes for Barby’s dolls,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
tying on her big garden hat, she went over
across the road, and down around the corner, to
the big house where Mrs. Fargo and Johnny had
come to board for the summer, arriving a week
earlier than they intended, as it was warm at
home, and Mrs. Fargo watched jealously over
Johnny’s health.</p>

<p>“It does seem so very nice to have you here,
dear Mrs. Fargo,” she said, coming upon that
lady in one of her big square rooms. For Mrs.
Fargo had taken the whole upper floor of the
house, and was in the depths of the misery of
unpacking the huge trunks with which the rooms
and hall seemed to be full, the maid busy as a
bee in the process, while Johnny was under foot
every other minute in a way terrible to behold.
“And now I’m going to help.” She laid aside
her big hat on the bed.</p>

<p>“O Phronsie!” cried Mrs. Fargo, turning a
pink, distressed face to her, “it’s perfectly lovely
to see you; but you’re not going to work, dear.
It’s bad enough for me. Joanna, the nails aren’t
out of that box of books. You’ll have to go
down, and tell Mr. Brown to come and draw
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“I’ll draw them,” cried Johnny, springing out
from behind a trunk he was trying with all his
might to move. “I’ve got my own hammer; yes,
sir-ee! Now get out of the way; I’m coming.”</p>

<p>“O Johnny! you can’t,” remonstrated Mrs.
Fargo quickly. “You’re not big enough; it
needs a strong man.”</p>

<p>“I’m ’most a man,” said Johnny, twitching
away from her. “I’m going to do it.”</p>

<p>“But your hammer is in the box of your
playthings,” said Mrs. Fargo, glad to remember
this.</p>

<p>“I don’t care; I’ll get Mr. Brown’s, then,” declared
Johnny, prancing off.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! Phronsie, do stop that boy,”
begged Mrs. Fargo, tired and distressed.</p>

<p>“Johnny,” called Phronsie softly. She did not
offer to go after him. “Come here, dear.”</p>

<p>“Am going for Mr. Brown’s hammer,” said
Johnny, edging off.</p>

<p>“I want you, dear.”</p>

<p>“Am going for Mr. Brown’s hammer.” Yet
he came back. “What you want?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take you over with me, if your
mamma says so, to our house; and if you’re very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
good, Johnny, you shall ride on the donkey. May
I take him, Mrs. Fargo?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you only will!” breathed Mrs. Fargo
thankfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any old hammer!” screamed
Johnny in a transport; “the donkey’s a good
deal gooder,” scrambling down the stairs.</p>

<p>“And I’ll send Mr. Brown up to open the
box,” said Phronsie, tying on her hat, and going
after him.</p>

<p>But she didn’t get Johnny over to the donkey,
after all; for, just as she had seen Mr. Brown
on his way up-stairs to open the box, some one
ran up the steps, two at a time, with, “O Phronsie,
I’ve a day off!” most joyfully.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t see how, Dick,” said Phronsie,
looking at him from under her big hat.</p>

<p>“Never mind. I have it, anyhow; tell you
later. Now for some fun! That chap here?”
looking suddenly at Johnny, who now began at
the bottom of the steps to howl to Phronsie to
hurry for the donkey.</p>

<p>“Yes; they came a week sooner than they expected,”
said Phronsie. “They got here yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Botheration! Well, now, Phronsie, let the
boy alone. I’m only here for a day, you know.
He’s all right if turned out in the dirt to play.
I want you to go to drive.”</p>

<p>“I promised him he should ride on the donkey,”
said Phronsie. “I had to, for his mother
and Joanna have all the unpacking to do. And
he must, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Hand him over to me, then,” said Dick. “I’ll
give him a donkey-treat, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Dick; and then I can help
Mrs. Fargo,” turning back to the door.</p>

<p>“See, here,” cried Dick; “I’m doing this to
help you out of it. Now, you’ve got to go to
drive with me afterward, Phronsie.” He stopped
with his foot on the upper step, and looked at
her. “Grandpapa said I might try the new pair
next time I came out. Will you?”</p>

<p>“We can take Johnny,” said Phronsie, pausing
a bit. “Yes, Dick, I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“Bother him for a nuisance!” growled Dick.</p>

<p>But as this was all that he could get from
Phronsie, he hurried off, and overtook Johnny
trying to get on by himself to the donkey’s back,
where he peacefully browsed in the paddock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Hold on there!” roared Dick at him, as
only a college boy can roar. But Johnny was in
no mind to hold on to anything but the donkey.
This he did so effectually, sticking his toes into
the sides of the animal, that the donkey at last
sent out a hind foot. Away went Johnny, half
across the field, it seemed to Dick, hurrying up;
and then he lay still as a stone.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p060">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p060.jpg" alt="Johnny! open your eyes">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Johnny! open your eyes,” cried Dick.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Dick, in the greatest distress.
“Here, Johnny, open your eyes,” kneeling
down beside him on the grass. “Come, get up,
and stop shamming;” for there was a dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
feeling at Dick’s heart, that, if he didn’t keep
joking about it, Johnny would be found to be
hurt.</p>

<p>But Johnny wouldn’t get up, and he wouldn’t
open his eyes; so Dick was forced to pick him
up, the donkey, finding that he incommoded no
one by running away, now trotting up to stare at
the little figure on the grass. “Here, give me
some of that water,” cried Dick hoarsely, to one
of the stable boys, who appeared around the
paddock with a pail. “Dash it over his face,”
as the boy came shambling up. “Donkey kicked
him—oh, my goodness! he doesn’t stir,” as the
contents of the pail streamed over Johnny’s face.</p>

<p>“I’ll carry him for you,” said the boy, setting
down the pail.</p>

<p>“You get out—oh! beg your pardon—I’ll
carry him myself.”</p>

<p>Just then Polly looked out of the window,
humming the last bars of her sonata.</p>

<p>“Why, Dick!” as she spied him, “how funny
that you’re home. Oh, what”—as she caught
sight of a little boy’s figure in his arms.</p>

<p>“It’s Johnny,” said Dick, lifting his pale face
to the window, as he hurried along. But Polly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
didn’t hear; speeding over the stairs, she ran
out to the lawn, and over the walk to the paddock-edge.
“O Dick!” she exclaimed again.
Then she held herself in check, as she saw his
face. “I believe he’s all right,” she began cheerfully.</p>

<p>“He’s dead!” declared Dick hoarsely, and
staggering on.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Dick!—oh, no!” protested Polly, hurrying
by his side. “Bring him in here,” she
said, pointing to the side veranda.</p>

<p>Dick still staggered on, up the steps, and into
the house.</p>

<p>“Oh, if Papa Fisher were only here!” sighed
Polly; then she looked at Dick. “But how nice
it is that there’s such a good doctor here. You
know, Father Fisher told us to send for him if
anything was the matter with us. There, lay
Johnny on the sofa here, and then run, Dicky,
do, and get the doctor. He lives on Porter
Road, the third house this way. Take the pony-cart.
Dr. Phillips is his name,” she called after
him; then she touched the electric bell at her
elbow.</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Higby to come here at once,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Polly to the maid, who popped in her head in
obedience to the summons.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p063">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p063.jpg" alt="Oh, he’s rolled off">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Oh, he’s rolled off,” cried Polly, aghast.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I must get some hartshorn,” said Polly; “he
won’t stir, poor boy. I’ll run up to my room
and get it.” In less time than it takes to tell
it, Polly was off and back, to find Mrs. Higby
just arrived in the doorway, saying, “Did you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
want me, Ma’am? Jane said as how one of the
boys was sick.”</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Higby!” gasped Polly, the color beginning
to come back to her cheek. “It’s Johnny—on
the lounge. Here, I’ve the hartshorn,”
holding up the bottle. “He was kicked by the
donkey—Dick’s gone for the doctor.” All this
in one breath, as they were going across the
room, the good woman in advance.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,”—began Mrs. Higby.</p>

<p>“And some one must tell Mrs. Fargo,” mourned
Polly, back of the ample figure. “Why—where”—for
the sofa was empty.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s rolled off! though how he could, I
don’t see,” said Polly, aghast, and tumbling down
on her knees to peer under the sofa, Mrs. Higby
pulling it out from the wall to facilitate matters.
“He was just as if he were dead. O Mrs. Higby!
where do you suppose he is?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” declared Mrs. Higby,
thoroughly alarmed; “like enough, Mrs. King, it’s
flew to his head, and he’s gone crazy.”</p>

<p>At this direful prospect, Polly set up a most
diligent search here, there, and everywhere a
small boy of eight would be supposed to rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
under such conditions, assisted as well as she
could be by Mrs. Higby, whose ample figure, impelled
by her fright, knocked down more articles
than she could well set to rights again, until at
last they were compelled to call in others to the
search.</p>

<p>And in the midst of it all, they heard a shout
out in the direction of the stables; and, running
out to the veranda, they saw Johnny triumphantly
sticking to the donkey’s back, while he waved a
small switch the stable—boy had just obligingly cut
for him.</p>

<p>“Pay him up now for your tumble,” advised
the boy.</p>

<p>“See, I did get on all by myself!” shouted
Johnny at them. “Runned away when Mrs. King
went up-stairs;” then he turned, and waved his
stick at Dick and Dr. Phillips driving at a furious
pace into the side yard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

<small>CAN SHE GO TO MRS. KING’S RECEPTION?</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I ’LL ask Uncle Carroll. Uncle Carroll, sha’n’t
Aunt Fay take me? Please say yes.”</p>

<p>“No use to ask him, Grace; you’re too young.”</p>

<p>“<i>Please</i>, Uncle Carroll, don’t mind what Aunt
Fay says. Just <i>you</i> say I’m to go.”</p>

<p>“Where?” he dropped his paper.</p>

<p>“Out to Mrs. King’s reception to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You’re too young.”</p>

<p>“Child, I told you so,” said Aunt Fay quietly,
slipping the cosey on the tea-pot again.</p>

<p>“Too young!” Grace pulled savagely at the
girlish hair on her brow, and twisted her long
braid hanging down her back, up high on her
head.</p>

<p>“I’ll do up my hair, and pull down my face—so,”
lengthening her round cheeks—“anything,
to just get the chance of going,” she cried. “O<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Uncle Carroll! and I’m sixteen. You’re positively
cruel.”</p>

<p>“You’re nothing but a school-girl,” said Aunt
Fay; “the idea of going to a reception.”</p>

<p>“Why, those receptions of Mrs. King’s are
packed; you don’t seem to understand, Grace;
and you’d take the standing-room of some one
else,” added Uncle Carroll.</p>

<p>“I’d take my own standing-room,” declared
Grace positively, “and I wouldn’t tread on other
people’s toes;” seeing a chance for her, since the
two guardians of her peace had begun to argue
the point. “Just think, I’ve never seen the
King house nor Miss Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s a raving, tearing beauty,” said
Uncle Carroll, “and worth going miles to see,
I tell you.”</p>

<p>“And I want to see Mrs. King again,” cried
Grace, pursuing her advantage. “I got a peek
at her once, when she came to call at the Drysdales.
Bella and I heard she was in the drawing-room,
and we crept in behind the cabinet.
She was just lovely; and the color kept coming
and going in her cheeks, and her brown eyes were
laughing, and I’ll do anything to see her again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“She’s the rage, that’s a fact,” assented Uncle
Carroll. “Well, Mrs. Atherton, why don’t you
take the child for once; I would.”</p>

<p>“Carroll Atherton!” exclaimed his wife in
dismay, “how could I ever look her father and
mother in the face, and they’ve trusted her to
us, while she went to school, to do the right
thing by her. The idea of a sixteen-year-old
girl, and a school-girl, going to a reception!”</p>

<p>“The child won’t have a chance to get there
any other way,” observed Mr. Atherton. “One
little social break won’t matter.”</p>

<p>“The worst place to make a social break is
at Mrs. King’s,” said Mrs. Atherton. “No, Grace,
you can<i>not</i> go.” She set her lips tightly together.
“Any other thing you might ask, I’d try to indulge
you in; but I won’t make a <i>faux pas</i> at
Mrs. Jasper King’s.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything else,” cried Grace in
a passion. Just then a young girl ran over the
steps, and plunged without ceremony into the
pretty breakfast-room.</p>

<p>“Oh, joy—joy—joy!” she cried, beating her
hands together, “mamma’s going to take me to
Mrs. King’s reception to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69-70]</span></p>

<p class="caption">“The idea of a school-girl going to a reception,” said aunt Fay.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Bella Drysdale!” shrieked Grace, deserting
her chair to throw her arms around her friend.
“There, Uncle Carroll, now you see what Mrs.
Drysdale’s going to do for Bella,” she flung over
her shoulder, not deigning to notice her aunt.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” began Mr. Atherton.</p>

<p>“I shall see that lovely Mrs. King again,” cried
Bella in a rapture. “Brother Tom’s going to
get a look at Miss Phronsie; and we’ve got a
cousin from Chicago, and he’s going for the express
purpose of seeing her. Oh! everybody will
be there, Grace. Mamma says you <i>must</i> go.”</p>

<p>“You’re older than Grace,” began Mrs. Atherton
to gain a little time before the storm should
begin again around her head.</p>

<p>“Only one month,” said Bella; “what’s that?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen days!” cried Grace, “only sixteen
days! Just think of that paltry atom of time to
keep one away from that glorious reception.
Uncle, wouldn’t you be ashamed to have every
one know that Aunt Fay kept me away for just
sixteen days? I should positively die of mortification.”</p>

<p>“Well, you cannot go anyway,” suddenly and
decidedly declared Mrs. Atherton. Mrs. Drysdale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
or no Mrs. Drysdale, whom she followed when it
suited her to do so, she was determined to keep
to that decision. “It is of no use to argue and
to tease—you can<i>not</i> go.”</p>

<p>Bella dragged Grace off to her room, and shut
the door on their woes.</p>

<p>“I shall go! I shall go!” declared Grace in a
white heat, raging up and down the room.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy! Mrs. King won’t have you, if
you go on that way. She’s awfully nice and particular.
Stop it, Grace.” Bella shook her arm.</p>

<p>“I’m going—I’m going—I’m going, so there!”
declared Grace determinedly. “That’s settled.
Now, how shall I do it? Help me to think,
Bella.” She stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of thinking,” cried that young
lady, throwing herself on the broad window-seat
in among its cushions, and stretching restfully,
“as long as you can’t go?”</p>

<p>“As long as I can go, you mean,” corrected
Grace, an ugly little gleam in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a regular Western fury,” declared
Bella, regarding her. “Gracious, I wouldn’t have
taken you from the ‘wild and woolly plains’ as
your aunt has for a year!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Don’t speak to me of Aunt,” commanded
Grace, frowning heavily. “What has she done?
Kept me out of this, the thing I wanted most of
all. And besides, the ‘wild and woolly West’—why,
I haven’t been educated there, as you know.
It’s New England, if any place, that’s to blame
for me. Oh, oh, I’ve an idea!”</p>

<p>Bella sat up straight, the transition was so
great, to stare, as Grace ran softly to the door,
opened it, and looked and listened; then locked
it again, and tiptoed back.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” She seized Bella’s hands,
and dragged her off the window-seat. “I’m going
to be your Western friend; you put that idea into
my head—don’t you see? dressed up. O Bella,
you stupid, you owl, I’m going as your visitor;
and I’ll hire my bonnet and gown, and change
my hair, so Aunt won’t catch me. And—and—what
joy!”</p>

<p>When the luckless Bella, nearly danced out of
breath, was released, she made a faint protest.
But she was fairly talked off her feet again; and
by that time the fun of the thing had entered into
her soul and clutched her. So she said “yes,”
and began to plan as smartly as Grace herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“But mother never will take you in all this
world,” she said, sobering down.</p>

<p>“Did you for an instant suppose I was going
to let your mother know who I am?” cried
Grace, bursting into a laugh. “Oh, what a sweet
owl you are, Bella Drysdale! Of course I’m going
to fool her too.”</p>

<p>“Well, she won’t let me take a stranger,” said
Bella sharply, tired of being called an owl twice.
“I guess I’m as smart as you, Grace Tupper. I
should know better than to get up such a silly
plan.”</p>

<p>“I’m to be Miss Strange from Omaha, Nebraska,”
said Grace solemnly; “a pupil of Miss
Willoughby’s boarding- and day-school. All this
is true—my name is Grace Strange Tupper.
And because I don’t happen to board, instead
of going to her day-school at Miss Willoughby’s,
isn’t my fault. I would if I could. Now, Owlie,
do you see?”</p>

<p>“If you call me an owl again I won’t do a
single thing about it,” cried Bella stubbornly;
“that’s flat.”</p>

<p>“So she was a dear,” cried Grace, soothing her,
and launching at the same time into an animated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
discussion as to ways and means; which milliner
to hire the bonnet from, and which was the most
becoming way to do up her hair, and how to
darken her eyebrows, till Bella looked at her
watch aghast. “And I’ve a horrible French
letter to write for to-morrow, or Mademoiselle
will kill me, and mamma won’t let me go to
the reception.”</p>

<p>“Oh, misery! Hurry, do; run every step of
the way home,” begged Grace, nearly pushing her
out of the room as she ran off.</p>

<p>And the next afternoon Grace shut herself up
again in her room; and while the French maid
was evolving the usual fine creation out of her
aunt for the reception, Grace was also doing
wonders,—to steal softly down the stairs, and
out and away to Bella’s.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d save you the trouble of calling
for me,” she said, in a sweet little drawl
as far unlike her usual tones as possible, as she
entered the long Drysdale drawing-room. “Oh,
beg pardon, I thought Bella was here!”</p>

<p>“Er—no; allow me to do the honors.” A
tall young man with shoulders built for ball-team
work, came slowly into the centre of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
room. “Bella will be down soon. Take a seat,
Miss”—</p>

<p>“Strange,” murmured Grace faintly, and wondering
if her front frizzes had slipped, and if the
pencilling under her eyes looked natural. “I—I—it
isn’t any matter. I suppose I’m too early.”</p>

<p>She sank into an easy-chair in the darkest
shadow of the room, and covered her feet primly
with her hired gown, regardless of the wasted
elegance of her new little boots. These had been
her one extravagance; but now she was too far
gone to care whether or no they were seen.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bella’s the same as she was ten years
ago when I last visited here,” observed the young
man, carelessly leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece,
and staring at her. “She was always a
tardy little thing, I remember; kept us waiting
everlastingly when we were going outing.”</p>

<p>So this was Bella’s cousin from Chicago. Well,
he was perfectly horrid to talk that way of her
dearest friend; and besides, what sharp black
eyes he had, piercing through and through her.
She put her hand up involuntarily to feel of her
frizzes, shivered, and drew in her boots farther
than ever under her chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“I don’t think it is very nice to speak so of
your relatives when you are visiting them,” she
observed to her own astonishment. Then she
would have bitten out her tongue sooner than
have spoken.</p>

<p>“Er—oh, beg pardon, did you speak?” exclaimed
the young man, starting out of a revery.</p>

<p>Joy! he hadn’t heard her. “No—that is—it
isn’t any matter,” said Grace hastily. “I was
going to say I think Bella is perfectly splendid.
We all do at school.”</p>

<p>“You attend Miss Willoughby’s boarding-school,
I believe,” said the black-eyed young man, bending
on her a sharper gaze than ever. “It’s a
delightful school I’m told. Isn’t that a fact?”</p>

<p>Grace was saved from replying by his next
remark, which he presented without any pause
to speak of. “I’ve two cousins, Jenny and Francina
Day, there. I’m going over to call on them
this evening after dinner.”</p>

<p>Oh, horrors! Why hadn’t Bella told her of
this before she had taken upon herself such a
scrape! Well, there was no help for it now; there
was no other way, if she would see Mrs. King,
and be part and parcel of Mrs. King’s great reception.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
She tried to recover herself enough to
smile; but she felt, as she afterward told Bella,
as if her face wobbled all over.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to meet somebody who will give
me a sort of a welcome there. Fact is, I don’t
know my cousins by sight. Never saw but one of
them, and she was a kid of three years old. Are
they nice girls?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly splendid,” said Grace recklessly, glad
to think she had made up a long, outstanding fight
between Jenny and herself just the day before,
and stifling the qualms of conscience when she
reflected on Francina’s heavy dulness. “Oh, I’m
so glad they’re your cousins,” she said, smiling
radiantly.</p>

<p>The sharp-eyed young man showed two rows of
even white teeth as he also smiled expansively.</p>

<p>“Miss Willoughby is extremely gracious to allow
you to go to a swell reception,” he said
slowly. “If I’d supposed it would be of any
use, I’d have begged my cousins off. I presume
it’s too late for me to run around now and get
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes,” cried Grace, starting forward,
and beating one little boot in terror on the carpet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
“Miss Willoughby doesn’t like short notice
about anything; and—and—it’s an awful long
way there—and—here comes Bella.” To her
great relief in came that young lady, resplendent
in a new blue hat quite perky, with a grown-up
air that was matched by Bella’s manners as she
drew on a white kid glove.</p>

<p>Grace deserted her shady corner, and flew at
her. “O Bella, do hurry,” as she threw her
arm around her; “it’s dreadfully late; do be
quick; we ought to go.”</p>

<p>“There’s oceans of time,” said Bella with a
drawl, and smoothing out the little finger in a
painstaking way. “Mamma isn’t half ready yet—at
least she hasn’t her bonnet on. Oh! do you
know my cousin Charley Swan?” indicating with
a nod the sharp-eyed young man.</p>

<p>“We’ve entertained each other for a good half-hour
or so,” observed Charley, not particular as
to exact statements. “Say, Bella, if Aunt Isabel
isn’t ready, I believe I’ll run around to Miss
Willoughby’s, and get her to let Jenny and Francina
off to go with us. Stupid in me not to
think of it till I saw Miss Strange come in.”</p>

<p>“Er—ow!” Grace gave a sharp nip to Bella’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
plump arm. “Stop him,” she whispered tragically.
Bella pulled out a hair-pin from some mysterious
quarter under her hat, and set it in again,
before she condescended to answer. “No, you
must not, Charley,” she said, pursing up her
small mouth, and then falling to on her glove
again. “Button it, will you?” presenting it to
him. “You see, mamma will be very angry; for
she’s just as likely to settle her bonnet right
the first attempt. I’ve known her to. And although
Tom’s no doubt wrestling in the agonies
of tying his necktie, yet it’s just like him to hop
down without the least warning before you could
possibly get back. Then think of me!” She
spread her white gloves dramatically out, as if
words were unequal to the occasion.</p>

<p>Just then Tom whistled his way in. “Whew,
you ready in your togs, Charley! Well, it takes
you Western fellows to be spry. Where’s the
mother?” turning to Bella.</p>

<p>“Here’s Miss Strange, Tom,” said his sister,
clutching Grace’s arm; “haven’t you any manners?
Angela, this is my brother Tom.”</p>

<p>Grace started at the word Angela, and forgot
to bow, as Tom doubled up like a jack-knife and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
made her his best obeisance. Then it was too
late when she remembered; and she stood there
blushing under the hired bonnet, till Charley remarked
in a way that did not help matters any,
“Oh, so I am an older acquaintance of Miss
Strange than you, Tom.”</p>

<p>“How did you ever tell such an awful story as
to say my name was Angela,” cried Grace in a
whisper as they hurried off to the carriage, Mrs.
Drysdale at last appearing.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so; stop pinching me; I’m black
and blue already,” retorted Bella. “I’ve a right
to call you what I’ve a mind to. And I’m going
to call you Angela the rest of this blessed afternoon.
So mind you act as if you’d heard the
name before. If you don’t, I’ll tell everybody
who you are.”</p>

<p>This had the effect of throwing Grace into such
a panic that she answered Mrs. Drysdale’s kind
attempts at conversation with her at random,
and the twenty miles to Badgertown were made
in a whirl of emotions possessing her, till by the
time the train paused at the little station, she had
a confused notion of either telling her whole
story and throwing herself on the mercy of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
chaperone, or of picking up her long skirts, and
fleeing over the country meadows toward home.</p>

<p>Instead, she was saying, “Thank you; yes,
I’d rather walk,” to Cousin Charley. Bella and
Tom said the same thing. Mrs. Drysdale was
helped into one of the carriages that always ran
back and forth on Mrs. King’s reception days—a
bevy of ladies and gentlemen filling the others;
and off they all set, to meet in the dressing-rooms
at “The Oaks.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>

<small>MRS. JASPER KING’S RECEPTION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WE’RE in an awful hole,” gasped Bella,
pulling Grace off to the farthest corner
of the dressing-room. “Er—do get away from
that maid; you don’t want her sharp eyes all
over you. No, we don’t either of us want any
help;” over her shoulder at that functionary.
“Now, Grace, er—Angela, you’ve gone and got
me into this scrape, and I shall never hold up
my head again in all this world.”</p>

<p>Poor Grace’s head couldn’t droop any more
than it did, as she mumbled miserably, “I know
it. Oh, dear me!”</p>

<p>This was worse than all, and Bella took fresh
alarm. “For mercy’s sake, hold up your head
and look big, as if you were somebody.” It was
now her turn to pinch Grace.</p>

<p>“I can’t; because I’m not somebody,” sighed
Grace. The frizzes even seemed to droop miserably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
on her brow; and she looked like a wilted
flower, all her smart hired glory gone suddenly
out of her.</p>

<p>“What a horrible scrape!” cried Bella between
her teeth. “Oh, dear me, Grace, you <i>must</i> behave!
Dear, dear!” as some ladies hovered near.</p>

<p>“I think your mother wants to go down now,”
said one; “she is trying to signal you. Introduce
your young friend to me, will you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t go down-stairs!” cried Grace in
a spasm of terror, and catching Bella’s arm in a
way to make her faint, as that young lady looked
over to the knot of ladies by the door, one of
whom was waving her fan frantically.</p>

<p>The lady who had requested the introduction,
extending her hand in a winning way, Bella
twitched away from the clutch, and said quickly,
“Miss Grace Strange—I mean Miss Angela Tupper.
Oh, dear me! I don’t feel very well, and
mamma wants me. Come on.” She fairly hauled
Grace out through the ranks of elegant women,
regardless of their dismay at her haste. “See
what you have done,” her black looks said when
at last she permitted Grace a glimpse of her face.</p>

<p>“You young ladies must attend to my movements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
and not expect me to signal you,” said
Mrs. Drysdale, her face only sweetly black, like
a becoming thunder-cloud, as Miss Willoughby’s
parlor boarder was one of the offenders. She
could scold Bella easier at home. Just then a
stout lady trying to get by, with a good deal of
jet trimming about her person, sent out one of
the octopus threads, and hooked Mrs. Drysdale in
the most vulnerable point,—the choice old lace
on her sleeves.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” panted the stout lady, pulling at
the entanglement. “There, break it, I’m sure I
don’t care.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it out,” cried Mrs. Drysdale in a
terror, laying a quick hand on it.</p>

<p>“Step out of the doorway, please,” said some
one. And the stout lady and Mrs. Drysdale
edged off as one person, and everybody in the
vicinity fell to helping; even Grace was brought
out of her misery enough to take her turn. As
she bent over her task, some one’s elbow gave
her French bonnet a knock. Out fell a hair-pin
from her frizzes, and she felt rather than
saw the curious eyes of the lady next to her
upon her hair. So she deserted the jet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
lace, making Mrs. Drysdale say with some asperity,
“I think you have not bettered it any,
Miss Strange.” Then she looked up into the face
of her next neighbor. She was the lady who had
asked Bella to introduce her.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Grace darted behind a tall fern, and hid her hot, distressed face.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Grace fled out into the wide upper hall, fragrant
with its wealth of blossoms, and darted behind a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
tall fern, where she hid her hot, distressed face,
and tried to stop the throbbing of her heart.</p>

<p>“Well, now get Miss Strange,” Mrs. Drysdale
was saying as she emerged into the hall. “It is
the last time I shall ever allow you to ask a friend
to go with you, Bella. Where in the world is
she?” peering about.</p>

<p>Bella flew back into the room. “Grace, Grace,”
she cried in a loud voice.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” said Grace miserably, and creeping
out from behind the fern. “I was so hot, and
it’s cool out here,” feeling the necessity for words
with the audience that now hung on the scene,
and the throng of ladies coming and going to
the dressing-room, and whose passage they were
blocking up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Drysdale did not vouchsafe a word, only
gave her one look, stepped back, and called her
daughter in a tone that scared Bella more than all
the rest, and the three sailed down-stairs. That
is, the lady sailed; but Bella went with the tread of
an angry young lion, while the parlor boarder at
Miss Willoughby’s slipped after as best she could.</p>

<p>The next thing she knew, she was being introduced
to a radiant vision, and feeling the warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
touch of a kind hand, and looking into clear brown
eyes, and hearing Mrs. Jasper King say, “I am
very glad to see you, Miss Strange.” And then,
despite the crowd pressing her, and that Bella was
picking her by the sleeve, the kind hand retained
her trembling one, “I want to see more of you.
Come up and speak to me later,” said Mrs. King,
and she smiled; and that cut deepest of all.</p>

<p>Grace broke away from her friends, and made
a dive for oblivion. Anywhere—perhaps behind
a sheltering palm, till the Drysdales were ready
to go home; she could watch and slip out then.
Instead, however, of reaching such a haven, she
ran against a tall young man in the hall, and not
stopping to beg pardon, rushed on.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Mr. Charley Swan startled
out of his politeness, and following her after
the rebound, “anything I can do for you, Miss
Strange?”</p>

<p>The sound of this name only added to Grace’s
terror, and he had some difficulty in gaining her
side.</p>

<p>“If you please, I’d advise you to stop. People
don’t run about in this way, you know, at receptions;
knocking folks down, and all that. Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
what’s the trouble?” He stood squarely in front
of her, and between annihilating with his looks
a curious youth who was taking this all in, and
preserving a calm exterior for the rest of the
throng surging through the hall, he still gave her
a penetrating glance.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so wretched!” gasped Grace, all caution
thrown to the winds, and clasping her hands.</p>

<p>“Not altogether festive,” said Charley Swan,
“that’s a fact. Well, now that orchestra’s going
to play, thank Heaven for that. You just take
my arm—Miss—Miss Strange, and we’ll get
out of this mob.”</p>

<p>He had to slip Grace’s hand himself within
his arm. There it lay, and shook like a leaf.
Charley piloted her into the large conservatory
opening into the library, and somehow she found
herself in a quiet corner with just room enough
for another person on the rattan seat.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s what I call comfort,” he said,
not looking at her, to give her time to recover
herself. “Mrs. King is a perfect marvel in the
flower line, and her music. Did you know that
all these orchids are given her by Mr. King the
father? Gracious! don’t I wish some old gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
would take a fancy to me, and pet me with
bank-notes and smother me in orchids. Look
around a bit, Miss Strange.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said Grace in a low voice; “I’ve
no right to.”</p>

<p>“Hush! here comes a perfect old harpy for
news, I know by her pinched-up nose, and the
way she sets her lorgnette. Hold your tongue,
Miss Strange,—beg your pardon, but it’s a desperate
case,—till she gets away. Yes, as I
was saying, these orchids are surely the rarest
specimens I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>The “old harpy” drew near, and levelled her
glances behind her lorgnette at Grace. It was
the lady who had asked Bella to introduce her
young friend.</p>

<p>“Are you ill, Miss”—she hesitated, and then
laughed unpleasantly, “Tupper—or—Strange?”
she asked sweetly, and drawing near till she stood
over the two.</p>

<p>Charley Swan surveyed her coolly as Grace
stammered out something.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he drawled. “Miss Strange was
faint; but as she is a great friend of our family
and came with us, I believe I can take care of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
her. Anything I can do for you, Miss—”
he hesitated, just as she had done, looking her
squarely in the face; so that, without supplying
the name, she murmured something about the
beauty of the flowers, and moved off.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="illus_p091">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Are you ill, Miss Tupper—or—Strange?” and she laughed unpleasantly.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Old reptile,” said Charley between his teeth.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” protested Grace, with a little
shiver; “she’s right. She sees I’m a humbug.”</p>

<p>Mr. Swan did not seem to be at all surprised
at this confession, but stood up suddenly.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said; “you keep your seat.
Don’t say a word; <i>she</i> won’t come back, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
don’t know any one else, I’ll be bound. Anyway,
don’t talk. I’m going to get you an ice.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried Grace, the color flooding her
face; “not a single thing; I won’t take it. I
can’t. Why, I’ve come here all dressed up as
one of Mrs. Willoughby’s parlor boarders. I’m
only Grace Tupper—you don’t know. It would
choke me.”</p>

<p>“It’s pretty bad, I’ll not deny,” said Charley,
sitting down; “but if everybody told how they
got to receptions, you wouldn’t be alone in humbuggery,
I’ll venture to say.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve disobeyed my Au—Aunt Ath—Atherton,”
said Grace, battling with her sobs, and
twisting her fingers to keep from crying like
a baby, “and—I—hired this bonnet, and—and”—</p>

<p>“And you’ve spoiled yourself with those horrid
eyebrows,” finished Charley; “and if I were
you, I’d take off that monstrosity of a frizz, and
put the thing in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t!” gasped Grace, raising her blue
eyes in terror to his face; “why, Aunt will know
me then.”</p>

<p>“Is she here?” demanded Charley with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
whistle. He couldn’t help it; this last was too
much even for him.</p>

<p>“Yes—that is, she was coming. Oh, dear
me! and I suppose I’ll be expelled from Miss
Willoughby’s school, and I’ll go home, and it’ll
kill father and mother and Jimmy and the baby.
I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“At least I believe we’ll save Jimmy and the
baby,” said Charley in a tone of encouragement.</p>

<p>“And Mrs. King smi—smiled at me.” Grace
broke down, and cried into her handkerchief, so
that Charlie jumped up. “See here,” he said
abruptly, “I want to take you down to see some
of the greenhouses; they’re wonders.” He made
her get up, and take his arm again, while he hurried
her off over the grounds. But they hadn’t
gone far, when she saw a lady in advance walking
with two gentlemen.</p>

<p>“There’s Aunt!” she cried; and before Charley
could say anything, she broke away from him,
and rushed down a side path.</p>

<p>It was worse than useless to follow her, as
the attention thus drawn to her would be disastrous.
So Charley sauntered along, first getting
a good view of “Aunt” in her lavender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
bonnet, so he would know her again, and then
hastening to the mansion, if perchance he might
befriend Grace once more.</p>

<p>“Charley Swan!” exclaimed Bella, running
up, “where <i>is</i>—er—Angela Strange?”</p>

<p>“Miss Tupper has just left me,” said Charley
gravely, and pausing abruptly.</p>

<p>“Miss Tupper? Oh, my good gracious!” cried
Bella with a little laugh, “you mean Miss
Strange.”</p>

<p>“She says her name is Tupper,” said Charley.
“I really suppose she ought to know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear! then she has told you,” said
Bella with a long sigh. “Well, I’m glad. Such
an afternoon as I’ve had!”</p>

<p>“See here, Bella,” said Charley. “You get
her; she’s run down that path,” nodding in the
direction of Grace’s flight; “and you and I will
take her home. She took fright because she saw
her aunt. Be lively now.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” cried Bella in vexation and
alarm. “Well, I’m sure, precious little comfort
I’ve had at this reception!”</p>

<p>“Hurry up, now. I’ll go in and make our
excuses to Aunt Isabel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>But when Bella reached a turn in the shrubbery,
she found a little heap on the ground, a
group of people bending over it, conspicuous in
the front being the lady who had asked her to
introduce Grace, now using a lorgnette most vigorously.</p>

<p>What happened next, Bella never could tell.
She only knew that the gardeners lifted Grace,
and carried her into one of the back doors, giving
her up to the care of the housekeeper, whom
they called Mrs. Higby, and that some of the
ladies and gentlemen followed, proposing various
remedies, the lady with the lorgnette pressing
after most assiduously.</p>

<p>“She tripped on her gown and fell just as we
were coming along,” said this lady sweetly. “She
seems somehow unused to a long gown. Let me
bathe her face.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Miss Phronsie,” said Mrs. Higby.
“Now that blessed dear has heard of the accident.
Make way for Miss Phronsie.”</p>

<p>Phronsie came softly up in her beautiful white
gown. She laid down her bunch of lilies-of-the-valley
on the table, and bent over the young girl,
laying a quiet hand on the cold one. “Poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
thing,” she said, and she dropped a kiss on the
white cheek.</p>

<p>To everybody’s surprise, two tears gushed out
and rolled down the white face. “Leave her to
me,” said Phronsie gently. “Now, if everybody
will please go out, Mrs. Higby and I will take
care of her.”</p>

<p>“You would better let me stay,” the lorgnette
lady had the temerity to say.</p>

<p>“We do not need you,” said Phronsie, coolly
regarding her. “Will you please go out with the
others?”</p>

<p>When Charley Swan came stalking in by the
back door, it was to see Miss Phronsie Pepper
with her arms around Grace as they sat on the
lounge in the housekeeper’s dining-room, and Bella
Drysdale crouched on the floor, with her hands
clasped in Phronsie’s lap.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“DON’T cry,” Phronsie was saying; “because
if you do, I cannot help you.”</p>

<p>“She has told everything—just every single
thing, Charley,” announced Bella, tragically turning
around to him.</p>

<p>Charley Swan stood like a statue, with no eyes
for any one but Phronsie. She turned a grave
face on him. “I’m afraid she’s badly hurt,” she
said. “I think you will have to get Dr. Phillips,
Mrs. Higby.”</p>

<p>“It’s only my foot,” said Grace with a little
moan.</p>

<p>“Let me go for him,” begged Charley, coming
out of his frozen state.</p>

<p>“One of the men’ll go,” said Mrs. Higby.
“La! don’t you stir a mite.” She went to the
door, gave the message, and came back with a
sigh of relief. “You poor child, you,” bending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
over Grace’s foot. “You must have turned it
clean over itself. There, there, the cold water’ll
be the best we can do for it till the doctor gets
here. My!” as her glance fell again on the
dark circles under the blue eyes, and the elaborate
frizzes; then she fell to coughing, and speedily
betook herself to the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>“I’ll hold her,” she said presently, coming back.
“Miss Phronsie, you’re wanted every single minute
in the best room. Let me sit there where
you be.”</p>

<p>Bella sprang to her feet, and blushed rose red.
“I forgot you’d left the reception. Oh, do excuse
me! And please, Miss Phronsie Pepper,
don’t stay here any longer.”</p>

<p>“I shall stay,” said Phronsie, “till I see that
she is better.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Phronsie? Mrs. Higby, do you know
where Miss Phronsie is?” cried old Mr. King,
putting his head in the doorway. “Oh, my good
gracious!” as his eye caught the group.</p>

<p>Grace hopped off the lounge, and hobbled along
on one foot. “Oh, sir! it’s my fault,” she panted;
then she fell flat on the floor.</p>

<p>When she came to herself, she was lying on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
bed whose white hangings she could dimly see as
she opened her eyes. Her foot felt heavy and
queer.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I cannot apologize enough to you,
Mrs. King,” said a voice that she was quite familiar
with. “This school-girl prank is quite
unforgivable, I know, but I hope you won’t lay
it up against me.”</p>

<p>“We ought not to talk here, Mrs. Atherton,”
said Polly gently; then they went out into the
other room.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Bella Drysdale is just the right
companion for her,” said Mrs. Atherton. “I have
thought so for some time. Now I shall do my
best to break up the intimacy.”</p>

<p>“Ugh—O Aunt Fay!” shrieked Grace, trying
to raise herself in bed. But she only succeeded
in falling back heavily with a groan.</p>

<p>“Dear me, that girl has quite upset me,” cried
Mrs. Atherton, trembling nervously.</p>

<p>“Do you stay out here, Mrs. Atherton,” said
Polly brightly, with a gentle hand putting her
on the sofa; then she went into the room where
Grace lay, closed the door, and stepped softly up
to the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Now, little girl,” she said, just as if Grace
were six years old instead of sixteen, “you must
stop crying, and do not move. If you do, your
foot may be injured for life.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help crying,” said poor Grace, covering
her face with both hands.</p>

<p>“You can help doing anything that is wrong,”
said Polly gently. Then she brought a brush
and comb, unpinned the frizzes, and laid them
on the white toilet-table, and began to brush
the soft, straight, shining hair.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Bella at all,” sobbed Grace. “She
didn’t want to do it, but I made her. Oh! I
can’t give Bella up, Mrs. King.”</p>

<p>“You shall tell your Aunt all about it when
you are better,” said Polly. “Now we must not
talk about it. You are going to stay with me until
your foot is well enough for you to be moved.”</p>

<p>“What, here in this house with you?” cried
Grace, almost speechless with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly; “you see, you’ve given
your poor foot a terrible wrench, and Dr. Phillips
isn’t willing that you should be moved just yet.
And he can come and see you so much easier
here, Grace.”</p>

<p class="caption">“I shall get my Mamsie,” cried a small, determined voice.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“O Mrs. King!” Grace rolled her head on the
pillow to look at her, “you don’t know how
wicked I’ve been. You can’t know, or you
never’d keep me here in all this world. Why,
I disobeyed my aunt to come here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do know,” said Polly gravely. “I
know it all. But I said we wouldn’t talk about
it now.” Then Polly sat down on the edge of
the bed in her beautiful reception-gown, and
Grace felt too wicked to touch it with one finger,
although she longed to; and Mrs. King held her
hand, and told her stories about her own girlhood,—how
the Peppers lived in the little brown
house just around the lane, “where you will go
when you are able to walk, dear;” and how
Joel was the pastor of a big church in New
York, and where Ben and Davie were; and how
the dear mother had gone abroad with Father
Fisher because he was tired and needed rest, and
wanted to visit the hospitals again, and some
foreign doctors; and then she told about Johnny,
and the railroad accident that took his mother
away to heaven, and how good Mrs. Fargo had
adopted him for her very own boy, and they
were there at Badgertown for the whole summer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
And how Mr. Higby, in whose farmhouse the
people were all carried who were hurt, had sold
his farm, and was now their head gardener, and
good Mrs. Higby was the housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think she is quite good,” said Grace,
snuggling up to the kind hand; “she didn’t scold
me a bit, but she looked so sorry for me, Mrs.
King.”</p>

<p>“And Johnny’s just the dearest dear,” said
Polly, who always believed him but little short
of a cherub; and then she told how he was thrown
from the donkey just the week before, but “it
didn’t hurt him a bit, and”—</p>

<p>“If you please, Mrs. King, the children are
ready to go to bed,” said Katrina, putting her
white cap in the door.</p>

<p>“And now I must go to my chicks,” said Polly,
getting off the bed. Then she bent over, and
set a kiss on the pale cheek. “Don’t you worry
about anything,” she said. “I shall ask my
sister Phronsie to stay with you.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. King,” cried Grace, nervously clutching
the brocade dress, “there is one thing,—if you
could keep Aunt Fay from writing this to my
mother. Oh, please do, dear Mrs. King!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“She won’t do it,” said Mrs. King quietly;
“don’t be afraid, Grace.”</p>

<p>Grace gave her one look, and relaxed her hold.</p>

<p>“I shall get my Mamsie,” cried a small, determined
voice; and Elyot rushed in in his nightgown,
followed by Barby in hers, hugging a
dilapidated black doll. “Mamsie,” cried Barby,
stumbling over to her arms.</p>

<p>“Don’t you go in there,” commanded King,
coming last, in his nightgown. “Sister Polly, I
couldn’t help it, I came to keep them out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me,” cried Katrina, who had gone
back after delivering her message, now hurrying
in. “Children, how can you!”</p>

<p>“Bad, naughty Katty,” said Barby, shaking
her curls at her, “to keep me away from my
mummy. Go ’way, Katty.”</p>

<p>“O Barby!” said Polly gently, and nestling
her little girl up to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a cunning little thing!” cried Grace
in a rapture. “Oh, do let her stay, Mrs. King!”
as Polly made signs for Katrina to take her.</p>

<p>“What you in my bed for?” cried King sturdily;
“say, and who are you?”</p>

<p>“O King!” said Polly; “why, that isn’t like
my boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Oh, have I taken his bed?” asked Grace
in dismay, and making another effort to rise.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p106">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p106.jpg" alt="Elyot perched at the foot, where he surveyed Grace at his leisure">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Elyot perched at the foot, where he surveyed Grace at his leisure.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“He calls it his because once when he was
sick he left the nursery and came in here to
sleep,” said Polly. “Now come, children, say
good-night to Miss Grace, and then we must fly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
to bed.” Elyot had one of her hands now; and
he clambered up on the bed, where he perched on
the foot, and surveyed Grace at his leisure.</p>

<p>“Is that her name because she says grace at
the table?” he asked after a pause.</p>

<p>“No, dear, that was her baby name; isn’t it a
pretty one?”</p>

<p>“Was she ever a baby?” asked Barby, looking
with intense interest at Grace’s long figure
under the bedclothes.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; she was once a little baby just
like all you children.”</p>

<p>“O mamma! not a <i>little</i> one,” said Elyot incredulously.</p>

<p>“Not a wee, wee, teenty one,” said Barby,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>“I guess she was as long as that,” said King,
measuring off a piece on Grace’s frame, that he
supposed a suitable length, “just about as long
as that.”</p>

<p>“Take care, dear. You may touch her lame
foot,” said Polly.</p>

<p>And then the children, who had been in the
little brown house when the accident occurred,
clamored to know all about it. But Polly was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
firm; and telling them they should hear how it
happened on the morrow, she held Barby down
for a good-night kiss, a proceeding all the others
imitated, till the three swarmed around Grace’s
pillow.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Barby, with a sleepy little
hum; “do you say ‘Now-I-lay-me-down-to-seep’”?</p>

<p>“No,” said Grace. How long ago it seemed
since she had felt too old to repeat that prayer!</p>

<p>“Mamsie, she doesn’t say ‘Now-I-lay-me-down-to-seep,’”
said Barby, trying to open wide her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Come, dears.”</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you say?” cried Elyot, pulling the
bedspread, “say?”</p>

<p>“Elyot!” said his mother. He took one look
at her face, and then scuttled off, picking up
the nightgown to facilitate progress.</p>

<p>So Polly went off, her baby on her arm. Barby,
whose eyes drooped at every step, dropped the
black doll out of her sleepy hand; Katrina picked
it up, and helped the boys along.</p>

<p>Just then Phronsie came in with a pleased
expression on her face to see how cheery everything
was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Your aunt has gone,” she said; “but she is
coming out to-morrow to see how you are.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe18_75" id="illus_p109">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">So Polly went off, her baby on her arm.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Grace achieved a sitting posture, impossible as
it had seemed before. “Oh, <i>dear</i> Mrs. King!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
she screamed, “now I know she will write to
mamma this evening.”</p>

<p>Polly set Barby in her little crib, then sped
back. “No, Grace,” she said, “she won’t write;
you can trust me, dear.”</p>

<p>“She always writes evenings when she’s anything
on her mind,” said Grace; “and she’d hurry
about this.” But upon Mrs. King’s assuring her
that she would take the care of this upon herself,
Grace cuddled down again, and let Phronsie
comfort her.</p>

<p>And by and by, while Polly’s messenger was
speeding to the city with just such a letter as
she knew how to write, addressed to Mrs. Carroll
Atherton, Mrs. Higby herself came up with
Grace’s supper; and when she saw how cheery
things were, and how everything was beginning
to mend, she put her arms akimbo, and said,
“My land! but you’ll be as spry as a cricket in
a week.”</p>

<p>“I brought you some flowers,” said Phronsie,
laying down a little bunch where Grace’s fingers
could reach them.</p>

<p>Grace looked at them, but did not offer to
touch them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“What is it?” asked Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Might I just have one little sprig of those
you held in your hand when you came after I
was hurt, Miss Phronsie?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, you may. Mrs. Higby, will you
get them? You may have the whole bunch,”
she said to Grace.</p>

<p>“Oh, only just one sprig, please,” said Grace
eagerly.</p>

<p>But the whole bunch of lilies-of-the-valley was
brought; and Grace held them in her hands, and
buried her face in them, and then she opened
her mouth obediently, while Mrs. Higby, after
tucking a napkin under her chin, fed her from
a generous plate of milk-toast, and everything
was getting quite jolly.</p>

<p>“She looks better already, don’t she, Miss
Phronsie!” exclaimed Mrs. Higby in admiration
of the effect of the treatment. “My! but ain’t
this nice milk-toast, though! I guess I know, for
I made it myself. There, take this, poor dear.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to make you all so much trouble,”
said Grace penitently, with her mouth half full.</p>

<p>“Don’t feed her too fast, please, Mrs. Higby,”
said Phronsie, looking on with the deepest interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“My land! she ought to eat to keep her strength
up,” said Mrs. Higby, plying the spoon industriously.
“Just so much milk-toast such as this is,
and every hour you’ll see that leg of hers getting
well like lightning.”</p>

<p>And then old Mr. King had to come and stand
in the doorway, and say how glad he was that
the foot was hurt no worse, for it had given him
a dreadful fright to see her fear of his displeasure.
And when Grace saw his handsome face light up
with a smile for her, her last fear left her; and she
gave a sigh of relief as he went off, obediently
finished the toast, and settled back on her pillow.</p>

<p>“Land, how weak she must be to eat like that!
she feels the need of victuals,” said Mrs. Higby.
“Now I’ll run down and make you another slice,”
nodding to Grace, “you poor dear, you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let her!” begged Grace in alarm.
“O Miss Phronsie! I couldn’t eat another morsel.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t want any more, Mrs. Higby,” said
Phronsie; “truly she doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“But just s’posin’ she should be weak and faint
in the night,” said Mrs. Higby. “I’d better
make just one little thin slice, hadn’t I, Miss
Phronsie,” standing irresolute in the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“No,” said Phronsie firmly. “I don’t think
you had, Mrs. Higby. There, I’m going to tuck
her up now, and then I shall stay with her.”</p>

<p>“Will you, Miss Phronsie?” cried Grace in
delight.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Phronsie, “I shall stay just as long
as you want me to.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br>

<small>POLLY MAKES MATTERS RIGHT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“POLLY,” said Phronsie the next morning, “I
do wish Mamsie was here.”</p>

<p>It was the first time that Phronsie had said anything
to show she wished the mother back; and
Polly, who knew so well how all such utterance
had been controlled, turned and stared at her.</p>

<p>“I do really wish that Mamsie was home
again,” said Phronsie, this time with a sigh,
shaking her head decidedly.</p>

<p>“How you can, Phronsie,” broke in Polly impulsively,
“oh, I don’t see, when you know how
Mamsie needed the change, and how she would
never let Papa-Doctor go alone! O Phronsie!”</p>

<p>But in spite of that, “O Phronsie!” Phronsie
still reiterated, “Yes, I do wish she was here!”
And then she told the reason.</p>

<p>“Poor Grace,” she said, “is crying, and Mamsie
would know what to say to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“She shouldn’t cry,” said Polly vexedly. “Dear
me, I think it is the weakest thing after a person
has done wrongly to cry over it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but Grace was very wrong,” said Phronsie
sadly; “and she can’t help it, Polly, when it
all comes over her again. Just think, she disobeyed
her aunt.”</p>

<p>“To disobey mother” had always been such
a heinous crime in the “Pepper children’s”
eyes, that Polly’s work dropped in her lap, and
she sat as still as Phronsie for the space of
a moment. Then she said brightly to cheer
Phronsie, “But it doesn’t help matters any to
cry over it. Yet to be sure,” very suddenly, “I
cried dreadfully when I’d been cross and hateful
to Mrs. Chatterton. To be sure, so I did.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Polly laid down her work, and went
swiftly out of the room. She positively ran into
the pretty bed-chamber where, under the white
hangings, Grace was sobbing her young heart out.</p>

<p>“Dear child,” said Polly, kneeling down by
the bed, and laying a steady and gentle hand on
the shaking figure, “I know just how you feel;
for I cried once, just as miserably as you are crying,
because I had been wicked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“<i>You</i> wicked!” cried Grace, backing up so suddenly
that Polly was nearly upset, “O Mrs. King,
that could never be!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Grace, but it was; and it was much worse
for me to be wicked, for I had had Mamsie all my
life,—and you don’t know what our Mamsie was,—while
you have been away from your mother,
you said, ever since you were six years old.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p116">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p116.jpg" alt="“Dear child,” said Polly, “I know just how you feel.”">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Dear child,” said Polly, “I know just how you feel.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Yes,” said Grace. It was some relief that she
did not have to tell that boarding-school life as
she had found it in New England schools was
ever so many degrees better than those years could
have been under the nominal care of a mother
given up to her own pursuits.</p>

<p>“And I was rude and hateful to a poor sick
old woman,” said Polly suddenly, laying her soft,
warm hand on Grace’s shaking ones; “and I said
awfully cruel things to her, Grace; oh, you can’t
think how it makes me feel now to remember
them!”</p>

<p>A tear or two crept out of Polly’s eyes as she
said this, and dropped on the counterpane.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re crying yourself, Mrs. King!” exclaimed
Grace, lifting her red, swollen eyelids in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Polly, smiling brightly, and
dashing off the tears with a quick hand. “You
can’t think how it makes me feel, Grace, after
all these years, to remember what I said to old
Mrs. Chatterton.”</p>

<p>“She must have been horrid to you to have made
you say those things,” said Grace stoutly. “I just
hate her, to make you feel badly even now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>It was a new thing to comfort any one else
and she pulled away one of her hands from
Polly’s clasp, and laid it on Mrs. King’s shoulder,
forgetting her own misery while she did so.</p>

<p>“She didn’t make me,” corrected Polly, “never
mind what she said to me. Mamsie always used
to say no one but ourselves could make us do
and say things. No, Grace; it was because I
lost my temper. Oh, I was so frightfully angry,
I remember! And then I went up-stairs as hard
as I could run, wishing every step that I could
only get back the words I had uttered; and I
hid in the trunk-room, and got down on the floor,
and cried and cried—oh, how I cried! And
then, when I finally came out and went down-stairs,
everybody was hurrying about, troubled
and anxious, because Mrs. Chatterton was ill;
and then I thought that I had killed her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” said Grace.</p>

<p>“And after that,” went on Polly, “I can’t tell
you how I felt. But I didn’t cry any more. I
just tried to do something for the poor woman.
And after the longest time, Grandpapa told me
Mrs. Chatterton had received bad news,—her
favorite nephew had been drowned at sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“I’m glad of that,” said Grace. “I mean, I’m
glad that you knew it wasn’t anything you had
said that made her sick. Well, do please go on,
Mrs. King.”</p>

<p>“This all happened—the telegram coming, I
mean—while I was up in the trunk-room,” said
Polly; “so of course I did not hear the news,
though everybody thought I had. But I felt,
oh, so dreadfully, that I had made her unhappy
just before that awful blow came. And I shall
always remember it.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t feel badly, dear Mrs. King,”
begged Grace softly, turning comforter. “Oh! I
wish you wouldn’t,” gently patting Polly’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“But I did not cry any more,” said Polly.
“I remember I used to squeeze the tears back,
when they seemed determined to come, as I
thought about it; for Mamsie had told us it was
very wicked to cry over anything we had done,
because it distressed every one about us.”</p>

<p>“Did she?” asked Grace with great interest,
as a wholly new idea struck her. “Why, I
thought one’s eyes were one’s own, and one could
do as she pleased with ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Ah, but you see, no one of us can do as she
pleases, Grace,” said Polly, shaking her head.
“That you will find out more and more, the
older you grow. And besides, Mamsie said it
was a great sign of weakness to give yourself
up to fits of crying after you had done wrongly.
I remember what she used to tell us: ‘To set
about righting the wrong was better than a
million tears.’”</p>

<p>“Mrs. King,” exclaimed Grace suddenly, letting
her hand fall idle on the bedspread, to peer
into Polly’s face, “I think your mother must
have been just the nicest”—mother, she was
going to say, but pulled herself up in time—“person
in all this world.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t guess what she was—what
she is,” cried Polly warmly, “till you see our
Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“And I won’t cry another single bit,” declared
Grace, setting her lips tightly together; and doubling
up her handkerchief into a little wad, she
threw it to the foot of the bed, as a thing for
which there could be no further use.</p>

<p>“That’s right, dear,” said Polly, setting a kiss on
the flushed cheek; “because, you see, it troubles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Phronsie dreadfully. She’s made almost sick by
it, Grace. You can’t think”—and Polly’s face
drooped.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear!” wailed Grace remorsefully,
and wriggling about in distress; “what have I
done? Oh! please, dear Mrs. King, do tell her
I’ve stopped crying, and that I never will cry
again in all this world. Please hurry, and tell
her so this very minute.”</p>

<p>“So I will,” promised Polly cheerily, and going
out. “And I will ask her to come in and see
for herself how good you are.” She gave her a
bright smile that seemed to hop right down into
the sorry heart, telling her there was still some
comfort left for her.</p>

<p>When Polly next looked in, about an hour after,
Grace was propped up against the pillows, her
fingers busy with one of the sails for the boys’
boats, Phronsie sitting by her side, stitching away
on the counterpart. A little table was drawn up
to the side of the bed, with the work materials
on it; and Phronsie had just been telling something
gleeful, for Grace broke into a merry little
laugh.</p>

<p>“Now, this looks something like,” said Polly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
approvingly in the doorway. She had her walking
things on. “Grace, dear,” she said, coming
in and standing at the foot of the bed, “I am
going to town this morning; and I thought I
would go around and see your aunt, Mrs. Atherton,—I
wrote her so last night,—and report how
well you are getting on. It will save her the
trouble of coming out. And now, do you wish me
to do anything for you?”</p>

<p>She sent a keen glance out of her clear brown
eyes full into the troubled face.</p>

<p>Grace threw down her work. “Mrs. King,”
she cried, while the hot blood went all over her
face, “I told Miss Phronsie I’d like to write to
Miss Willoughby, and tell her all about it.”</p>

<p>“You cannot write,” said Polly, while a gleam
of pleasure came into her face, “until Dr. Phillips
has been here and said you can. But I will
go to Miss Willoughby, and tell her everything
you say.”</p>

<p>“Will you, Mrs. King?” cried Grace. “But
oh, won’t it trouble you too much?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Polly, “it will not trouble me too
much, child.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. King,” said Grace, brokenly, and clasping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
her hands, “will you please ask Miss Willoughby
to forgive me for the disgrace I’ve brought
on her school; and please tell her I didn’t think
of that when I began. I thought it was only
myself I had to consider. And please tell her
I mean to study and do everything I can to
please her after this. But perhaps she won’t let
me ever come back to her day-school;” and Grace’s
face became suddenly overcast, as if she were going
to cry; but she bit her lips, and held her
hands tightly together instead. “Then I suppose
I must bear it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her every word,” said Polly. “Anything
else, dear?”</p>

<p>“If you could see Mrs. Drysdale, and tell her
how sorry I am, perhaps some time, in several
years, she’ll forgive me for disgracing her so.
Oh, and do tell dear Bella that she mustn’t mind
if Aunt Fay should happen to say anything cross
to her, because everybody knows now that Bella
didn’t want to take me here, but I made her.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?” asked Polly, after a pause.
“How about the hired bonnet and dress at the
milliner’s?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear!” cried Grace, with a rush of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
dismay at the throng of bad results of her wrongdoing;
“you can’t do all these things, Mrs. King!
Oh, dear me! what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Grace,” said Polly warningly.</p>

<p>Grace looked up and struggled with her tears,
but she could not say anything for a minute.
Then she broke out, “She said it would be five
dollars for the two; and my pocket-book is at
home. There’s plenty in it,” she added hastily,
in confusion, “for papa had just sent me on my
allowance; but I can’t get at it.”</p>

<p>“I shall go in and pay Madame Le Farge,”
said Polly quietly, “and then you can pay me
afterward, Grace. And Mrs. Higby is to pack up
the dress and bonnet, and send them in by express.
And Mrs. Atherton is to send your trunk
out to-day. Then, dear, you will be quite comfortable
as to clothes. Good-by;” and Polly came
around to the side of the bed, and leaned over the
back of the little table, and kissed her.</p>

<p>Grace, regardless of the fine walking-dress with
its dainty bonnet and lace boa, threw both arms
around Polly’s neck, and hugged her close.</p>

<p>“Take care,” warned Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Polly, taking a rosy face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
from the embrace; “no harm is done. That is
just the way we all used to fly at Mamsie. All
right, Gracie;” going off with a smile.</p>

<p>“And now I’ve gone and done the wrong thing
again,” mourned Grace in confusion, huddling
down into the bed, and not looking at the discarded
sail. “Oh, dear me! I wish I could think
in time.”</p>

<p>“King wants his boat-sails this afternoon,
Grace,” said Phronsie gently, “and I promised
them.”</p>

<p>So Grace picked up the boat-sail, with its needle
sticking in it just as she had thrown it aside, and
Phronsie gathered up the narrative of some funny
mishaps they had in a little German town when
they were all last abroad, and presently they were
both as merry again as before; and only the Dresden
clock on the white mantel interrupted them.</p>

<p>Without a bit of warning, the door that Polly
had left ajar was pushed wide open, and a tall
figure appeared just about to stalk in. “Oh, beg
your pardon!” he exclaimed, beating a retreat.</p>

<p>“O Joel!” cried Phronsie, jumping out of her
chair to run across the room and into the tall
figure’s arms, “when did you come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Just got here,” said Joel; “walked from the
station; didn’t run across anybody but Patsy on
the grounds. Anybody sick? and who’s that?”
nodding into the room, as they had now edged
off into the hall.</p>

<p>“That’s a friend,” said Phronsie, “who only
came yesterday, and she fell and hurt her foot.
O Joe, it is so good to see you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is good to be here,” cried Joel, feasting
his eyes on her. “Well, where’s Polly?”</p>

<p>“Gone to town,” said Phronsie; “and she said
we were not to wait luncheon for her.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” said Joel, “for I must be off
this afternoon;” and he pulled out his watch.
“And now I’ll tell you, Phronsie, what I’ve come
for. I want you and Grandpapa to go back with
me for a few weeks. I can’t tell you why now,
only that I want you both. I’m dead tired of
being alone. Now, do persuade him to come,
Phronsie.” Joel took her hand and held it close,
his other arm being around her.</p>

<p>“O Joel!” cried Phronsie in great dismay, “I
can’t go just now. Could you wait a few days,
perhaps a week; could you, Joey dear?”</p>

<p>A sound very much like a groan came from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
room behind them. Phronsie tore herself away
from Joel, stepped back, and shut the door. “Oh,
how could I be so careless!” she said remorsefully.
“Now she’s heard every word we said,
poor thing.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br>

<small>ALEXIA COLLECTS THE NEWS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOEL ran off for a little visit to Grandma Bascom,
at which time he unloaded himself of
various packages, to find places for them on her
cupboard shelves alongside the cracked sugar-bowl
that had been supposed to contain Mirandy’s
“wedding-cake receet.” Then he shut up his
disappointment to himself as best he might, and
took the last train for New York alone.</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped, Joe,” old Mr. King had
said; “Phronsie has her hands full with that girl.
So you must wait for us.”</p>

<p>“Bother that girl!” Joel looked. Then he
thought better of it. “All right; come when you
can,” he had replied, as his brow cleared. On the
way to the station he ran across Alexia, who had
just arrived, as usual in a terrible hurry to see
Polly.</p>

<p>“Goodness me, Joel, you here!” she exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
with no show of ceremony. “Don’t I wish I had
a parish, and could run about the country as you
do; and here I am tied to a husband and a baby.”</p>

<p>“Poor husband and baby!” said Joel with a
grin, who liked Alexia immensely, but always
kept her on short commons of flattery.</p>

<p>“The most dreadful thing, Joel, you can imagine,”
gasped Alexia. “Oh, dear me! I’ve hurried
so—to tell Polly—there’s a girl who wormed
herself into her reception, and”—</p>

<p>“Whose reception—the girl’s, or Polly’s?”
asked Joel.</p>

<p>“You know—Polly’s of course. She pretended
to be”—</p>

<p>“Who—Polly, or the girl?”</p>

<p>“Joe Pepper, if you don’t stop and listen, I’ll
never, never speak to you again!” cried Alexia in
a pet.</p>

<p>“That would be terrible,” said Joel with a
laugh. “Good-by, Alexia,” putting out his hand,
“I shall lose my train if I stay to get to the end
of that recital.”</p>

<p>“Joe, Joe!” cried Alexia, running after him.
But he strode off, calling back, “I’ll trust Polly.”
And his train approaching the depot, Alexia, bemoaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
her fate in not getting out to Badgertown
earlier, skipped off to “The Oaks” in no very
pleasant frame of mind.</p>

<p>“Where’s Polly?” she cried to Phronsie in the
conservatory as she ran through the library.</p>

<p>“Polly’s gone to town,” said Phronsie, cutting
off some blossoms to add to the bunch in her
hand.</p>

<p>“To town! Oh, dear me!” screamed Alexia.
“And I’ve only just come out! What <i>did</i> she
want to go to town to-day for, Phronsie?”</p>

<p>“She had to go, Alexia,” said Phronsie, pausing
as she saw Alexia was really distressed; “what is
the matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh! then I must tell you,” said Alexia. “Oh,
my! I’m so hot, as if I’d run every speck of
the way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get you a fan,” said Phronsie, coming into
the library. “There are some, Alexia, on the
table.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” Alexia possessed herself of one,
and fanned vigorously, so that she set all the
feathers on her much-betrimmed hat into a violent
flutter. “Oh! it’s all over town, Phronsie,” she
said.</p>

<p class="caption">“Polly’s gone to town,” said Phronsie, cutting off some blossoms
to add to the bundle in her hand.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“What is all over town?” asked Phronsie
quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh, about that dreadful Strange, or Tupper
girl—how she wormed herself in here at Polly’s
reception. I heard of it this afternoon, and I
just stopped to run home and tell Baby I was
coming out here to let Polly know. Oh, dear
me!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for Grace,” breathed Phronsie pityingly.
“Oh! I hope she won’t know anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“Sorry for Grace,” repeated Alexia, throwing
down the fan, “well, I should say! I believe it
was all a plan between Mrs. Atherton and that
Mrs. Drysdale, to get her here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Alexia! it wasn’t,” said Phronsie decidedly,
shaking her head; “because Grace has
told us all about it. It was nobody’s fault but
her own.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t abide that Mrs. Drysdale,” declared
Alexia, who had reasons of her own for not
being in love with that lady; “and as for Mrs.
Atherton, why, she’s well enough, I suppose,
only a trifle weak in the upper story. Well, and
oh, dear me! Miss Fitzwilliam said”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Did Miss Fitzwilliam tell you,” asked Phronsie
quietly, “the story of Grace’s coming here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Alexia; “she told us all. And she
said she saw through her disguise, and that it was
Mrs. Atherton’s niece.”</p>

<p>“Who are all?” asked Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Why, all of us in the Campbell’s drawing-room,
child. What makes you question a body
up so close. It doesn’t make any difference, does
it, where or how I heard it, if everybody’s talking
of it?”</p>

<p>“Everybody isn’t a few people in Mrs. Campbell’s
drawing-room, Alexia,” said Phronsie; yet
she sighed, and the bunch of flowers in her hand
trembled a little.</p>

<p>This made Alexia more vexed than ever. “Well,
there was Captain Sledges; he’s home on a furlough,
you know; and, oh! the Romeynes from
New York, and two or three others, besides some
of our Berton set,” said Alexia. “Oh! there was
quite a nice little lot, Phronsie, to hear the news.
And I just tore out, I was so vexed, and only
stopped to tell Baby, and”—</p>

<p>Phronsie turned her brown eyes full on Alexia.
“I hope you stood up for poor Grace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
She’s only sixteen, and she didn’t stop to think,
she says.”</p>

<p>“I stand up for her—how could I?” cried
Alexia. “I never saw the girl. Oh, dear me! now
you’re going to take her part, and comfort and
pet her. It’s just like you, Phronsie; I wouldn’t
go near that Atherton house, nor even send a
word to her.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary,” said Phronsie, in the quietest
of tones; “for Grace hasn’t been home, and
she’s going to stay here, I hope, a good while.”</p>

<p>“She’s in this house?” screamed Alexia, tumbling
off the sofa to gain her feet, “oh, my good
gracious me, Phronsie Pepper!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Phronsie; “she’s in this house,
Alexia. She fell yesterday, and hurt her foot
very badly; and Dr. Phillips said this morning
when he saw it, that she ought not to be moved
for a week or two. And Polly’s had her clothes
sent out, and I hope she’s going to stay a good
while; for I like her, Alexia, very much indeed.”</p>

<p>It was a long speech for Phronsie to make; and
she sat quite still after it was over, and looked
at Mrs. Dodge.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! and now you’ll give up all your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
time to taking care of her, and coddling her up.
How do you know but what she will go and do
something just as bad when she gets well again?”
cried Alexia.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I know she won’t, Alexia,” said
Phronsie, shaking her head decidedly. “She’s
awfully sorry and ashamed, and she’s been made
almost sick by it.”</p>

<p>“So she ought to be,” cried Alexia wrathfully.
“Now I know what Polly’s doing in town to-day,
running about in the heat—she’s fixing up the
trouble this girl made.”</p>

<p>“Alexia,” said Phronsie in a tone indicative of
the deepest distress, and leaning forward to whisper
the words, “I almost know that Grace’s
mother never told her about what was right and
wrong—I really believe she didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, supposing she didn’t; are you going to
take other people’s children, and bring them up?”
exclaimed Alexia. “Phronsie Pepper, I should
think you’d enough on your hands with that
Orphan Home down at Bedford, without any more
young ones to look after!”</p>

<p>“And Grace has been away at boarding-school
ever since she was six years old,” mourned Phronsie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
without paying the slightest heed to Alexia;
“dear, dear, just think of it, Alexia.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I might as well talk to the
wind,” exclaimed Alexia, “as to try to reason you
and Polly against such a Quixotic scheme. Dear,
dear, I can’t do anything with either of you.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Phronsie, “you can’t, Alexia. And
now I want you to come up and see Grace—how
nice she is. And you must tell her something
lively to amuse her. Do, dear Alexia.”</p>

<p>She got off from the sofa, and put her arm
around the tall, slim figure.</p>

<p>“Ugh!—no, I can’t.” Alexia edged off. “It’s
bad enough for you to pet and coddle her; I’m
going home.”</p>

<p>“Come, Alexia,” said Phronsie, holding out her
hand; and Mrs. Dodge, grumbling all the way,
went up the stairs after her.</p>

<p>“And just to think,” she said, when they
reached the top,—“wait a minute, Phronsie,—how
it’s all over town about her getting in here
so; and you’re giving up your time, and Polly’s
too, to take care of her, I”—</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned Phronsie, picking Alexia’s
sleeve, and pointing to the door of the little room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Ugh!—oh, goodness me! I thought she was
in the west wing,” gasped Alexia, in a stage
whisper. “Well, I don’t believe she heard anything.”</p>

<p>“Please remember Alexia, to tell her amusing
things, for Grace has been so sad,” said Phronsie,
softly drawing Alexia into the room. There was
no one in the little white bed.</p>

<p>Out in the dressing-room they found her, crying
bitterly, and trying to pull her clothes out of her
trunk. “I’m going home,” she exclaimed passionately
between her sobs.</p>

<p>“O Grace!” cried Phronsie, hurrying forward to
lay a restraining hand upon her.</p>

<p>“Oh, me—oh, my!” exclaimed Alexia, backing
up for support against the door.</p>

<p>“Please call Mrs. Higby, Alexia,” said Phronsie.
And Alexia, glad to do something, fled with
long steps, and presently brought Mrs. Higby,
who, without any more ado, just picked up Grace,
with a “Poor lamb, there, there, don’t cry!” and
deposited her on the little white bed again, where
she shook with the passionate declarations that
she was going home, and no one should stop her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higby examined critically the bandaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
foot. “Lucky if she hain’t hurt it,” and she drew
a long breath, “I don’t b’lieve she did, Miss
Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” sobbed Grace; “I hopped on
the other foot. Oh, dear, dear!”</p>

<p>“Please go out,” begged Phronsie. When the
door was closed she put her hand on the hot
brow. “Grace,” she said, “I am disappointed
in you.”</p>

<p>“I heard what she said,” cried Grace in a
gust, and throwing both arms suddenly around
Phronsie. “O Miss Pepper, just get me to
Aunt’s—do! I’ll make her let me go home.
And I never’ll trouble any one any more.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be moved yet,” said Phronsie;
“and it remains with you to say whether or no
you will be a good girl, Grace, and be a comfort
to us.” Grace could take but one look at her
face, it was such a disapproving one, and she
disappeared as far as she could beneath the bedclothes.
“I heard what she said,” she reiterated
faintly.</p>

<p>“Ah, Grace,” said Phronsie sadly, “when we
have done wrongly, we must just make up our
minds to bear what people say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Alexia knocked timidly at the door. “Come
in,” called Phronsie.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry you heard what I said,”
she mumbled, going up to the foot of the bed,
“everybody don’t know it—only a few people, I
guess. And anyway, I suppose Polly, Mrs. King,
will fix it up, and I’m real sorry for you, and
I’ll help you—oh, dear me!”</p>

<p>Phronsie looked at her gratefully. “Alexia,
will you tell her about your baby,” she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that blessed child!” began Alexia in delight;
“yes, indeed, that is, if you’ll take your
head out of those bedclothes. I never could talk
to any one unless I could see at least their nose.
Well, now, that’s something like. You know,
Miss—Miss”—</p>

<p>“My name is Grace Tupper,” said Grace, who
had pulled up a very red face to lay it against
the pillow.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; well, you must know, Miss Tupper,”
ran on Alexia, “that I really have the best baby
in the whole world. He’s a perfect beauty to
begin with, and he’s ever so many teeth, and he
talks, and what do you suppose he was doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
when I got home?—I only ran out to pay a few
visits, you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Grace faintly, as Alexia
waited for her to speak.</p>

<p>“Why, he was trying to brush his own hair,”
said Mrs. Dodge. “Now, that blessed child must
have known his hair didn’t look good. Bonny,
that’s his nurse, lets him muss it up dreadfully,
and so the poor dear was just doing it for
himself.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she gave him the brush to play
with,” said Grace, interested at once.</p>

<p>“Never mind how he got it,” cried Alexia,
“he was brushing his hair. Now, I call that very
smart indeed; I’m almost afraid to think what
he will become, Miss Tupper, when he grows up.
There isn’t anything that’ll be quite the thing
for him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he can be President of the United
States,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, no!” cried Alexia hastily. “There
have been twenty-four of them already. I want
my boy to be something new, and ahead of other
people. And just think, it won’t be but a little
while before he’ll be in college, and then he’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
be through, and then I’m sure he’ll want to be
something quite unusual; I’m sure he will.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked Grace, wishing she
could see this wonderful baby.</p>

<p>“Algernon Rhys Dodge,” said Alexia; “isn’t
it just a beautiful name? I wanted to call him
after his father, ‘Pickering;’ but I knew it would
be ‘Pick’ all the time to distinguish him, so I
gave it up. Well, you’ll see him often, because
we’re going to move out to Badgertown next
week.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” cried Grace, “how nice!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Alexia, pleased at the effect of
her efforts to entertain, “we are; into the dearest
little yellow cottage, with barberry-bushes in
front. I’ve named it, ‘The Pumpkin’ and”—</p>

<p>“O Alexia! you are only in fun now,” said
Phronsie with a little laugh.</p>

<p>“Indeed, and I’m not,” said Alexia; “I’m having
my cards engraved so. Why shouldn’t I
have that name, when it’s just the color of a
pumpkin, and not much bigger? and lots and
lots of places have the most ridiculous names,
and no rhyme nor reason for them either. You
must come and visit me at ‘The Pumpkin,’ Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Tupper, when we get in nicely. Then you’ll see
for yourself, if you ever knew such a baby as
that blessed child of mine. Oh, here’s Polly!”</p>

<p>Polly came in swiftly. She had a little white
look around her mouth, as if she were very tired,
but she smiled brightly. “It’s all right,” she
said to Grace. “Oh, how nice and cheery you
are here! Alexia,” and she beamed on her,
“you’re as good as gold, to come out and be a
comfort.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” exclaimed Alexia, “don’t praise me,
Polly.”</p>

<p>“Go and take your things off, do, Polly,” begged
Phronsie.</p>

<p>Alexia sprang after Polly as she went out.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve been a horrid mean thing, Polly,”
she cried, when safe in Polly’s room, “and I
messed things up generally. But I’ll help you
now, and she’s a dear, that Grace Tupper is, and
you must go for that dreadful Fitzwilliam to-morrow;”
and then she told Polly the story of
her afternoon.</p>

<small>PHRONSIE SETTLES THE MATTER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUT Polly didn’t take Miss Fitzwilliam in
charge; for Phronsie came to early breakfast
the next morning with her little brown bonnet
on, that, with the walking-suit, meant a day
in town. “I am going to Berton,” she said,
“with Jasper.”</p>

<p>The small red breakfast-room at “The Oaks”
was always cosey for the early meal that Jasper
took every morning before he grasped the “little
publishing bag” and hurried off for his train.
Polly sat behind the coffee-urn, pouring a cup for
him.</p>

<p>“Why, Phronsie!” she exclaimed in surprise;
then she asked, “does Grandpapa know?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Phronsie; “I told him last night.
I was going to tell you, Polly, but you were busy
in the den with Jasper.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll pour you a cup of coffee,” said Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“No,” said Phronsie; “I’ll have just a glass
of milk, the same as every day, Polly.”</p>

<p>“O Phronsie!” remonstrated Polly, “take the
coffee, do, dear; it will be a hard day in town.”</p>

<p>But Phronsie shook her head. “Polly,” she
said, as she got into her chair, and the butler
had gone out and closed the door, as he always
did that Polly and Jasper might talk through
the meal, “I am going to town to see Miss Fitzwilliam.”</p>

<p>“Phronsie!” exclaimed Polly in great dismay,
letting fall her spoon; Jasper set down his cup
to look at Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” said Phronsie, beginning to drink
her milk. Then she took a piece of toast and
buttered it.</p>

<p>“If you are going to town, Phronsie,” began
Polly quickly, “do have a hot chop, dear.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Phronsie; “I do not want it, Polly.
I am going to take an orange in my bag. Please,
Polly, let me tell you about it.”</p>

<p>Polly looked over at Jasper in despair. His
eyes said, “Don’t worry, dear. Perhaps she
won’t do it.”</p>

<p>“You see,” said Phronsie deliberately, “Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Fitzwilliam must not be left to spread the story
about Grace. And she won’t want to when I
tell her all about it. She’ll feel sorry that she
told in the first place.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know Miss Fitzwilliam, Phronsie,
if you say so,” burst out Polly. “She’s the
veriest gossip there is in all Berton—or the
universe either. It won’t do a bit of good for
you to go to see her. She can’t change, child;
she’s too old.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but she must,” said Phronsie, shaking
her head; “and if nobody tells her how wrong
it is to set people against Grace—why, she
will go on doing so all the time.”</p>

<p>“Phronsie,” said Polly desperately, and leaning
past the coffee-urn, “I can’t bear to have
you put yourself in that old gossip’s house. Oh,
dear me! why is it that nobody puts her down?
Everybody hates her; and then they listen to
her stories just the same.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Jasper, pushing back
his chair; “they listen to her stories, Polly, as
you say. They’re as bad as she is, every whit.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t see them all, I’m afraid,” said
Phronsie, setting down her empty glass. “Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Fitzwilliam started it, so I ought to talk with
her.”</p>

<p>“Phronsie, does Grandpapa know you’re going
to see Miss Fitzwilliam?” asked Polly, seeing
here a ray of hope that the visit to town would
be given up.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! did you think I would go to see
her without telling Grandpapa, Polly?” asked
Phronsie with a grieved look in her brown eyes.</p>

<p>“No, dear,” said Polly hastily.</p>

<p>Then she got out of her chair, and ran around
to drop a kiss on Phronsie’s yellow hair; but
Phronsie moving just then, the kiss fell on the
little bunch of brown flowers on the top of her
bonnet. “Dear me!” said Polly with a laugh,
“well, I’m sure I’m willing to kiss your bonnet,
Phronsie, as it isn’t all decked up with birds’
wings. I knew, of course, you’d tell Grandpapa
everything, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t wear a bird’s wings on my
bonnet; you know I couldn’t, Polly!” exclaimed
Phronsie in horror.</p>

<p>“No more could I,” declared Polly. “I should
feel as if I’d murdered the sweetest thing on
earth, to perk a bird up on my bonnet. Oh, dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
me!” aghast at the thought. “Jasper, what
shall we do,” as Phronsie got up and went over
to the sideboard to get an orange for her bag,
“to keep Phronsie from going to town?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we better try any more, Polly,”
said Jasper, going over to take his wife’s hand.
“I really believe it’s best to let Phronsie alone,
for she thinks that she ought to go.”</p>

<p>“But that old thing!” began Polly impulsively,
“and our Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“It won’t hurt Phronsie,” said Jasper wisely,
putting his arm around Polly’s waist, to look
into her eyes. “No, Polly, I don’t believe we
ought to say any more. Come, Phronsie, are
you ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” said Phronsie, patting her little
bag; “all ready, Jasper. Polly, I’ll get your
red wool; you said you didn’t have time yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear!” cried Polly, comforted by
Jasper’s words. “But don’t tire yourself, Phronsie;
it’s no matter; I can wait.”</p>

<p>“If anybody is going to town with me, she
must hurry up; that’s all I say,” called Jasper,
giving Polly a kiss and, running off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Polly ached to say, “Don’t go to Miss Fitzwilliam’s,”
as Phronsie set a kiss on her cheek;
but remembering Jasper’s words, she smothered
the longing with a sigh. “Well, good-by, child,”
as Phronsie ran down the path to the dog-cart
that was to carry them to the train.</p>

<p>When Phronsie left Jasper as he turned off into
the business section, and she waited for the electric
car bound for the old residential part of the
town, he gave her a bright smile. “Success to
you, Phronsie dear! What train are you coming
out on?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Phronsie; “don’t wait
for me. I wish you wouldn’t, Jasper.”</p>

<p>“All right. It shall be as you wish, Phronsie.
Good-by, dear.” He flashed her another smile,
and was off, to plunge into the work of the day.</p>

<p>“I do think Jasper is the dearest brother that
ever lived,” said Phronsie to herself as she hurried
on her car. A little old woman, whose back
was bent, and the ends of whose white hair had
escaped from her rusty black bonnet, stood in
her way, clutching one of the leather straps that
hung from the bar that ran across the top of
the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Move up in front,” shouted the conductor,
giving a push to the little old woman’s back;
“this lady can’t get in.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p150">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p150.jpg" alt="Phronsie led the little old white-haired woman to the vacated seat">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Phronsie led the little old white-haired woman to the vacated seat.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Never mind,” said Phronsie; “I can stand
here just as well.”</p>

<p>“Move up, I say,” repeated the conductor, with
another shove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Thereupon three or four collegians, bound for
the university a few miles off, precipitated themselves
out of their seats, the fortunate one who
was first, hustling against the little old woman
in black. “Will you take my seat?” taking off
his cap to Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Phronsie gravely. Then
she touched the bent shoulder gently, and took
hold of the pinched hand clinging to the strap;
the other one she could now see was filled with
bundles. “Here is a seat for you;” and before
any one could say anything, she had led the
little old white-haired woman to the vacated
seat, arranged her bundles more comfortably in
her lap, and gone down to the end of the car
again.</p>

<p>The collegians’ faces got dreadfully red. No
one of them dared to try it again, for an old
gentleman who had seen it all had gotten out
of his seat, and with a courtly bow was proffering
it to her.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Phronsie was saying, refusing it,
with a smile. “I really do not mind standing.”
And the three collegians melted out suddenly to
the front platform, and away the car flew, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Phronsie was soon at the corner down which
she was to turn to the three story brick house
that had the honor to be owned by Miss Honora
Fitzwilliam.</p>

<p>She was in, the trim maid said; and Phronsie
gave a sigh of relief, as she stumbled on down
the darkened hall, to find a seat in the still more
darkened drawing-room, whose door the maid
opened deferentially.</p>

<p>“What name?” she asked in the same manner.</p>

<p>Phronsie took out a card from her plain brown
leather case. The maid departed, bearing this evidence
that Miss Sophronia Pepper, The Oaks, Badgertown,
was awaiting Miss Fitzwilliam’s pleasure.</p>

<p>It was fully half an hour before that lady
made her appearance, with everything as fresh
as possible about her, her side-curls beautifully
gotten up. Even the lorgnette was ready.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am <i>so glad</i> to see you, my dear Miss
Pepper,” she began effusively, extending both
hands, “Phronsie, I may call you, may I not?”
Phronsie did not answer, only to say, “Good-morning;”
so Miss Fitzwilliam exclaimed hastily,
“That stupid Eliza! this room is as black as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
midnight.” She stepped to the other side of the
apartment, and gave a nervous twitch to the bell.
“Let some light into this room,” as the maid
came in; “how careless of you not to open the
shutters by this time.”</p>

<p>Eliza opened her mouth to say something, but
evidently was too frightened to carry out her intention,
and throwing the shutters wide, hurried
out of the room as if glad to get away.</p>

<p>The morning sunlight flooded the long drawing-room,
whose faded coverings looked tired out;
several thin places very near to becoming holes
could plainly be seen on the furniture, while
even the mantel ornaments looked depressed.</p>

<p>Miss Fitzwilliam sprang to her feet, and energetically
thrust the shutters half way to. “That
stupid Eliza!” she ejaculated again. “I hope,
Miss Pepper, that you are not troubled as I am
with servants. They are really the plague of my
life, although I change every fortnight or so.”
Then she came back and sat down on the faded
red sofa by Phronsie’s side. “What a most beautiful
reception your sister’s was, to be sure!” she
cried rapturously. “I always make it a point to
exert myself to go to Badgertown whenever she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
gives one. And I’m so sorry for you, that you
were all so annoyed Tuesday by that”—</p>

<p>“Miss Fitzwilliam,” said Phronsie, breaking in
to the stream of talk. “I have come to see you
about that very thing.” Then she looked steadily
into the little steel-gray eyes before her.</p>

<p>“And have you, my dear?” cried Miss Fitzwilliam
delightedly. “I suppose you want my advice
what to do.” She tried to lay her pinched and
restless fingers on the quiet gloved ones in Phronsie’s
lap, to show her sympathy; but the young
girl not stirring, Miss Fitzwilliam pulled hers
back, and went on rapidly, “As it was such an
outrageous thing, I would”—</p>

<p>“Miss Fitzwilliam,” Phronsie did not pause
now, but went swiftly on to the end, not removing
her gaze from the other’s face, “I’ve come to
see you about this matter, because I know that
after you’ve heard all about it, you’ll be sorry for
the young girl who did such a wrong thing. Just
think, she’s only sixteen, and she hasn’t been with
her mother only vacations when she was home
from school, since she was six years old. And as
soon as she did it, and got there to the reception,
she’d have undone it all if she could,—oh, a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
times! And she made Bella Drysdale take
her. Mrs. Drysdale didn’t know anything about
it, but thought she was a parlor boarder at Miss
Willoughby’s; and Mrs. Atherton didn’t know
either. Grace has told it all to us, and that she
alone was to blame. It was the first time that
she has ever done such a thing, and she didn’t
stop to think before she did it. And now she
can’t forgive herself; she must always be sorry
to the end of her life: so all of us must help her
to bear it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Phronsie Pepper!” screamed Miss Fitzwilliam,
throwing away her self-control as Phronsie
paused, “you don’t mean to say that you think
people should take up this Tupper girl; why, I’ve
told everybody I could about it! I went around
yesterday, and I’m going again this afternoon.”
Her thin face glowed, and her pinched-up nose
was set high in the air with positive delight.</p>

<p>“I know you did tell them yesterday,” said
Phronsie quietly; “but I think you’ll be sorry for
that when you come to think it over.”</p>

<p>“Sorry? Indeed, no!” sniffed Miss Fitzwilliam.
“I shall get as many as I can to know it before
nightfall. It’s my duty. Sorry, indeed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Phronsie surveyed her gravely. “You will
be very sorry, I think, Miss Fitzwilliam,” she
said again quietly; “it will spoil that young
girl’s whole life, to repeat that story.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be very glad,” cried Miss Fitzwilliam
shrilly, “that I did take the pains to tell it,
and to warn people against such a little impostor.
How do you know that she won’t repeat this experiment
again at your house?”</p>

<p>“She will not, because”—</p>

<p>“And that stuff about hurting her foot was half
of it made up,” said Miss Fitzwilliam; “that’s the
reason I wanted to stay and help you. I found
her out long before.” She gave a little triumphant
cackle; “and I wanted to see her foot, if that
wasn’t all a pretence, so”—</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it wasn’t!” said Phronsie, who couldn’t
help interrupting; “because she”—</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t let me stay. However, I
have started the story about her, I am glad to
say; I suppose she went home soon after, didn’t
she?” she asked quickly, greedy for the last
bit of news.</p>

<p>“No,” said Phronsie; “she did not.”</p>

<p>“That shows what kind of a girl she is!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
exclaimed Miss Fitzwilliam with venom, “after
worming herself in there, to hang on until you
had to send her home.”</p>

<p>“Miss Fitzwilliam,” said Phronsie so decidedly
that Miss Fitzwilliam pulled herself up at the
beginning of another harangue, “don’t you understand—can’t
you understand, that Grace Tupper
is not that kind of a girl at all? She began
this as a childish freak; she is most dreadfully
sorry for it, and she would give everything—yes,
the whole world,” said Phronsie, clasping
her hands while her face drooped sorrowfully,
“if she hadn’t done it.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Miss Fitzwilliam in disdain.
Then she put back her head on her spare
shoulders, and laughed loud and long. “Anyway,
Miss Pepper, I shall do as I think best
about it. And I do think best to tell this story
wherever I have a good opportunity.” She set
her thin lips together unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Phronsie, rising, “I will
trouble you no further. And will you be so
very good, Miss Fitzwilliam, as to discontinue
calling at ‘The Oaks’? Grace Tupper is our
guest, our <i>dear</i> guest; and my sister, Mrs. King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
and I hope that she will stay there a long time,
for we are both already very fond of her. I
will bid you good-morning.”</p>

<p>It was impossible for Miss Fitzwilliam to get
her breath to speak. Twice she essayed it, but
no words came; and vexed that she had made
such a terrible blunder, and with her own hand
cut off visiting relations with Mrs. Jasper King
and her sister, Miss Pepper, she made another
effort, this time even managing a ghastly smile.</p>

<p>“Of course if you are going to take her up,
why I will let the matter drop,” she gasped.
But Miss Pepper did not appear to notice, nor to
observe the outstretched hand, but went swiftly
out. On the old-fashioned table in the hall was
the morning paper, still unread. Wild with chagrin,
Miss Fitzwilliam seized it to divert her mind,
as the door closed after Phronsie; and whirling
the sheet to the social news, read: “Miss Grace
Strange Tupper, niece of Mrs. Carroll Atherton,
is the guest of Mrs. Jasper King at ‘The Oaks’
Badgertown.”</p>

<p>When Phronsie completed her round of calls,
beginning with Mrs. Coyle Campbell, everybody
knew that it was to be the fashion to take up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Grace Tupper. And each one vied with the
others, to be ahead in the matter of sympathy
and help.</p>

<p>Then Phronsie hurried down town to buy
Polly’s red worsted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br>

<small>SUCCESS FOR POLLY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE grand extra concert, the best of the year,
given by the Symphony Orchestra, with
Mrs. Jasper King as pianist, was over, and only a
delightful memory. Every member of the orchestra
declared no such performer on the piano had
it ever been their good fortune to accompany,
and musical critics went a little wild in their
efforts to find adequate expressions to describe her
treatment of the theme she had chosen.</p>

<p>It was a great society event; all the fashionable
world of Berton being in evidence, with good
sprinklings from New York and other towns to
overcrowd the house. But Polly, although her
heart responded, most especially for Jasper’s sake,
to these tokens of cordial interest and admiration,
felt her whole soul drawn to the old friends who,
here and there, were in conspicuous seats among
the audience. They were all there, as far as was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
possible. Miss Salisbury, who had left her school
and the duties that never before allowed her to
wander, recklessly dropped all this time into the
sub-principal’s hands, and went off to hear her
dear old pupil, Polly Pepper.</p>

<p>Cathie Harrison, living in the South with her
grandmother, made that old lady pick up her
belongings, and take a two weeks’ jaunt, that included
Berton on its return. Amy Loughead in
New York, under the care of her aunt, Mrs. Montgomery,
of course was there; the two happening
to take the same train on with the Rev. Joel
Pepper, who had collected his friend Robert Bingley
for that very purpose.</p>

<p>The Cabots and Van Meters, besides Ben Pepper,
who represented that house now, the Alstynes,
Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton Dyce, and a score or more
of other old friends, all turned up at the last
minute, and electrified Polly with swift glances of
recognition across the crowded hall, that cheered
her on over the difficult passages better than any
applause could possibly have done. Charlotte
Chatterton seemed to be the only one left out.
She was in Europe, turning out something wonderful,
if accounts were true, with her voice—“unlocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
by Phronsie’s golden key,” Charlotte
always said, in telling how Phronsie’s generous
gift of a portion of old Lady Chatterton’s money
had made it possible for her to cultivate her one
talent. Charlotte’s love for Phronsie was so passionate
it seemed to outrun her love for music,
making it a dreary exile for her to stay and study
abroad. Only the hope of seeing Dr. Fisher and
Mother Fisher kept her from running off with a
homesick heart to the dear old friends.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Mason Whitney of course were
there, and Van, mightily proud of being in his
father’s business, and engaged to one of the
sweetest girls born and brought up in his set,
“the little blue-and-white creature,” whom Joel
so desperately entertained at the Welcome-Home-party
years ago. Van had regularly offered himself
to Phronsie at any and every opportunity
that had presented itself in the past three years,
to be as regularly but more gently refused. And
now he had wisely concluded to pass that pleasing
attention down to Dick, or rather Dick had
taken it upon himself, with small care whether
or no Mr. Van passed it along. And Van had
looked around for the best way to settle in life, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
get ready for that partnership with his father
which he fondly hoped was just ahead of him;
so he proposed and was accepted promptly by
Gladys Ray, who had, it seems, been waiting for
him all the time; and everybody was delighted;
and Van was so important with it all, his mother
having brought along little Miss Ray in the party,
that Percy, a newly fledged lawyer with his shingle
just out, who was in the party also, found it
hard to bear with equanimity his unimportance,
and the trouble of his monocle, just assumed.</p>

<p>Dick brought along a whole lot of his jolly
brother collegians, among them the three who
figured in Phronsie’s car episode, and who trusted
not to be recognized; but Dick, not knowing
anything of it, hauled along this identical trio,
after the concert, and presented them, “Mr. Fox,
Mr. Beresford, and Mr. Sargent,” when they immediately
had the appearance of desiring to melt
away again.</p>

<p>Dick was here, there, and everywhere on this
occasion, bubbling over with jubilation. Was he
not to go into the house of Marlowe &amp; King “the
very day after graduation—yes, sir!” to begin
his dream of being a publisher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>But the best of all, in Polly’s eyes, was the
presence of Jasper’s and her dear friend David
Marlowe, who sat in one of the front rows. Mr.
Marlowe never took his eyes from Polly; but
sat quietly through it all, when it became impossible
for the other friends to control their intense
interest. But how his keen gray eyes glistened!
And when it was all over, he put his good right
hand on Jasper’s, “My boy!” said he in that
strong, clear voice of his; and Jasper knew all
his friend’s heart better than if many words had
been uttered.</p>

<p>The only disappointment in certain quarters
was that Polly had issued her command that no
flowers should be given, thus throwing Dick, as
well as some other friends, into incipient rebellion.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Polly, who dearly loved to
be elegant in just the right way, when some inkling
of Dick’s extravagant plans had come to
her, “not so much as a solitary sprig—now
remember, Dicky,” one glance of her brown eyes,
and Dicky and everybody else knew that offence
in this respect meant a terrible thing.</p>

<p>But afterward, when they got Polly away from
“the mob,” as the collegians called it, of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
swarming up to congratulate, then Jasper took
matters into his own hands, and disclosed the
surprise he had planned for Polly; and with Mr.
Marlowe’s aid, he piloted all the old friends, and
a goodly number of new ones, to the special cars
waiting for them, and away they all went for
dinner, and to top off the evening at “The Oaks.”</p>

<p>Phronsie had sent a very special invitation to
Mr. and Mrs. Carroll Atherton, to Mrs. Drysdale
and to Bella, and also to “Cousin Charley
Swan;” so they all came. And Miss Willoughby
was there, and she found an old schoolfellow in
Miss Salisbury before the evening was half out;
and everything went merrily as possible in every
section of the big company.</p>

<p>And Alexia, whose little “Pumpkin” was bursting
with guests, up for the occasion,—she having
stipulated that Cathie Harrison and Cathie Harrison’s
grandmother should be part of her especial
share,—was there in full force, helping, with
Mrs. Fargo and Pickering, to receive and do the
honors, having “told the baby all about it before,”
and consigned him to Bonny’s tender mercies.</p>

<p>And when the dinner had proceeded to the
toasts, Jasper looked across the table into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
wife’s eyes, “Yes, Polly,” he said to her questioning
look, “I cabled Mamsie the very minute you
finished playing.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he did!” cried Mr. Marlowe, smiling
into her rosy face.</p>

<p>“O Jasper, how lovely of you!” cried Polly
with dewy eyes. “And is that what you signalled
the usher for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” he said, smiling at her; “I had
it all written before. You didn’t think I could
leave the dear Mamsie a minute longer than was
necessary without the news?”</p>

<p>“No, Jasper,” she said; “but oh, how lovely
in you to do it!”</p>

<p>Phronsie, opposite Grandpapa, who was stately
and resplendent at the head of one of the other
tables, looked over happily, “O Jasper!” she exclaimed,
clasping her hands, “does Mamsie really
know it now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Phronsie,” said Jasper, beaming at her;
“she really does.”</p>

<p>Phronsie sat quite still, her hands remaining
clasped. It was as if the dear Mamsie’s face was
really there before her, with the light and cheer
that always made everything bright; and a tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
look came into Phronsie’s eyes and around the
curves of her mouth. And then her face drooped;
and the dreadful longing that she had had every
minute since Mother Fisher had sailed, just to see
her again, settled down upon her. “Mamsie!”
she breathed slowly, but in a way to make everybody
turn and look at her.</p>

<p>Just then the heavy brass knocker on the front
door clanged sharply. One of the maids brought
in a yellow envelope, which she handed to Jasper.
He tore it open quickly. “O Polly!” and
across the table it sped to her. “Give it to
Phronsie; let her read it first, dear. It’s from
Mamsie!”</p>

<p>When they all came out of the babel of confused
delight, Phronsie still sitting with clasped
hands but radiant face, Jasper stood up and
read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To my dear Polly, I send my proud and loving word.
I knew she would do it. And give my love to Phronsie.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mamsie.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“We’ll drink her health,” cried Jasper. “Simmons,
pass the loving-cup.”</p>

<p>So the butler took down the massive silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
loving-cup, that had been for generation after generation
in the King family, from the oaken sideboard,
and filled it with pure cold water to the
brim, “The only thing worthy of it,” said Polly;
and all the company stood up, and Jasper lifted
it high, with “Our Mamsie, now as always our
guide, our comfort, and our delight; we pledge
ourselves anew to her in loyal love.” And then
the cup went around silently to every one.</p>

<p class="caption">The loving-cup was filled with pure cold water to the brim, “The only

</figure>

<p>And Ben proposed Father Fisher, and everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
drank his health and happiness; and then
Polly turned a happy face over toward old Mr.
King. “Our dear Grandpapa was <i>everything</i>,”
she said; “I don’t know what we should ever
have done without him.”</p>

<p>And around went the loving-cup again. And
this neat little speech so touched the old gentleman
that he got out of his chair, and responded
right gallantly to his daughter, and to the rest
of the “Five Little Peppers.” And Jasper’s
eyes shone with proud delight, and everybody
applauded to the echo. And then Davie, the new
instructor in literature at a Western university,
and already booked in the minds of all present
for the professor’s chair, was called out for a
speech; and a right good one it was too, the
Rev. Joel pounding vigorously his approval above
all the others on the festal board.</p>

<p>And Hamilton Dyce tried his hand at talking
a bit, and brought down the house with many
funny reminiscences; and Mr. Marlowe said, as
he always did, exactly the right word in the
right place; and Joel was called for loudly, but
he had slipped away just then, so several of
the others talked; and then Jasper brought down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
his improvised gavel, the handle of Grandpapa’s
cane, “Speeches declared over! We will now
adjourn to the little brown house;” and Polly
led off proudly with Grandpapa, as was quite
right, Phronsie and Mr. Marlowe following, the
rest of the company falling in as they chose,
with Jasper at the rear corralling all the stragglers
into line.</p>

<p>“Let’s march all around it, father dear,” whispered
Polly, gleefully as a child. So they led
off in the moonlight the long procession around
and around the little brown house, till some one
proposed unwinding and going the other way.
But they didn’t do it, but just broke ranks, and
rushed unceremoniously into the old kitchen.</p>

<p>And there were Polly’s two hundred candles
she longed for in the old days, all alight most
merrily, which explained the Rev. Joel’s absence
from the last part of the speech-making; and
after that there was no more quiet. The old
kitchen resounded to the babel of happy voices,
until at last everybody drew up in a circle of
chairs, getting the Peppers in the centre, whom
they besieged for stories of those old times.</p>

<p>“I’m a Pepper!” cried Jasper, scrambling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
into the charmed circle. “I was in those happy
days.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jappy belongs to us,” said Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Jap always felt so smart,” declared Van enviously,
“because he knew the Peppers first.”
Percy looked as if he wanted to say as much,
but concluded to keep still, and only readjusted
his monocle to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t any of us have had or done anything
if it hadn’t been for Jappy; hey, old fellow,”
declared Ben, clapping him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“And dear Grandpapa,” cried Phronsie, with
a world of affection in her eyes, looking over at
him.</p>

<p>“Well, Phronsie did it with her gingerbread
boy,” said Jasper quickly. “It was Phronsie,
after all, who brought us all together.”</p>

<p>And then everybody clamored for the story of
the gingerbread boy again; so off they rushed on
that, old Mr. King edging his chair a little nearer
to the Pepper circle. And then Polly’s old stove
had to come in for a share of attention, and
how she had to stuff all the cracks with paper,
and Ben stuffed it with putty, and— “Davie
gave boot-tops,” broke in Joel, grimly even now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
at the remembrance of how he felt because he
hadn’t any to give.</p>

<p>And then that brought up Mamsie’s birthday
cake, and the momentous work of getting ready
for its baking; and how Phronsie’s toe was
pounded; and how good Grandma Bascom was,
and how she wasn’t able now to get out of her
bed because of the rheumatism, but that those
guests who stayed over were to go down the
lane to see her to-morrow.</p>

<p>And how the cake, compounded after “Mirandy’s
weddin’ receet” was at last made, and
hidden in the old cupboard.</p>

<p>“Joe was such a precious nuisance in those
days,” said Jasper, “always poking and peering
around; I suppose they were afraid he’d find it
out.”</p>

<p>“We truly had a dreadful time,” said Polly,
shaking her head, “to keep him away from that
cupboard.”</p>

<p>“That old cupboard!” declared Joel, bounding
out of the circle to swing wide the upper door.
“Oh, what a lot of conniving, and how many
dark conspiracies it might tell!”</p>

<p>And how the dreadful measles fell upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
whole Pepper flock, and the dear mother was
almost in despair, and how good dear Doctor
Fisher was, and how he saved Polly’s eyes, and
then got her her stove. And then how the wonderful
Christmas had come from Jappy and Grandpapa,
and Polly had her bird and her flowers,
and Ben had made a Santa Claus wig out of
the hair in Mamsie’s old cushion, sprinkling it
snowy white with flour. And how Mamsie had
hidden all the splendid presents over at Parson
Henderson’s.</p>

<p>“Such a time as we had,” breathed both the
parson and his wife, who had run up from the
Orphan Home at Dunraven for the occasion.</p>

<p>Well—and how Phronsie had her doll, such
a gorgeous affair she was afraid for days to show
her to Seraphina, for fear of hurting the feelings
of the latter. And then Phronsie had to
get out of her chair, and make her way out of
the circle surrounding the Pepper group, and go
into the bedroom, where, kneeling down before
the old bureau, she drew with a loving hand
from the lowest drawer the two dolls.</p>

<p>“Bring the little red-topped shoes, too, Phronsie,”
called Polly; “do, dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe18_75" id="illus_p174">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p174.jpg" alt="With her arms full, Phronsie entered the kitchen">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">With her arms full, Phronsie entered the kitchen.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So Phronsie reached back into the farthest corner,
and carefully drew out a tissue paper bundle
that held the precious shoes, just as she had
worn them last; and with her arms full, she
was just entering the kitchen, all eyes upon her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
when Polly said in answer to some question,
“Yes, Mamsie wrote they would be in Rome
next month.”</p>

<p>Grace Tupper sprang suddenly from her chair.
“O Mrs. King! will they, will they? Then perhaps
they will see my cousin Roslyn May.”</p>

<small>ON THE WAY TO THE BEEBES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I ’M going down to see dear Mr. Beebe and dear
Mrs. Beebe,” cried Elyot suddenly the next
morning; and he threw down the small trowel
with which he had been spatting his mud-pie into
shape, and jumped up, “Come along, Barby, you
may go too,” he said. “We won’t trouble anybody
to take us, ’cause they’re all busy. I know
the way.”</p>

<p>“I know the way too,” declared Barby sturdily;
and deserting the spatting of her mud-pie which
she had been engaged in without the aid of a
trowel, she stood straight, and thoughtfully rubbed
her fingers on her brown linen pinafore.</p>

<p>“Huh—you’re too little to know the way,”
laughed Elyot; “but then I’m here, I can take you
down,” he added patronizingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be tooken; I’m going myself,”
said Barby decidedly; “this very one minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
I’m going;” and she trudged off in the direction
of the high road, not once looking back.</p>

<p>Elyot ran after her in alarm, and twitched her
pinafore, “That isn’t the way; we’ve got to go
down through the lane.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see my own Mr. Beebe, and
my very own Mrs. Beebe, all alone by myself,”
declared Barby, keeping on. And presently, coming
to a descent in the ground, she dropped flat,
and rolled over and over, her usual method of
going down hill; at the bottom picking herself up
to resume her journey.</p>

<p>“I’ll scream right out, and then they’ll come
after us, and we won’t either of us get there,” said
Elyot, taking long steps down the bank after her.</p>

<p>Barby stopped at this, and waited for him to
come up. “You may come too,” she said; and
she put out her fat little hand to him.</p>

<p>Elyot took it contentedly. “You see, Barby,”
he said, “you couldn’t get along without me. We
must keep out of the road at first, because it
would worry folks to see us going alone. But I
know the way perfectly; and then how glad dear
Mr. Beebe and dear Mrs. Beebe will be when they
see us coming in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Oh, so glad!” hummed Barby; “I guess they’ll
be very glad, Elyot. And I shall just kiss dear
Mr. Beebe, and say, ‘How do you do, dear Mr.
Beebe, pretty well I thank you mostly.’”</p>

<p>“No, Barby, you don’t say the things together
like that,” corrected Elyot; “that isn’t right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” contradicted Barby sturdily. “And
I shall say, ‘How do you do, my dear very own
Mrs. Beebe, and pretty well I thank you mostly.’
I’ve heard Mrs. Higby say it.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say such things, Barby,” ordered
Elyot, shaking her small sleeve with determination.
“You don’t know how to make calls yet.
Mamma wouldn’t like you to talk that way.”</p>

<p>“My mummy would,” declared Barby, shaking
herself free, and panting from her exertions. “My
mummy loves dear Mr. Beebe and dear Mrs.
Beebe, and Barby loves them too. And I shall
see all the shoes, all the little wee baby ones, and
the great big ones, and I’m going to stay all day,
and have pink sticks for dinner.” She turned her
hot little face up at him, and struck off bravely
again, but her feet dragged.</p>

<p>“You’re getting awfully tired,” said Elyot;
“let’s go back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“No, no, no!” protested Barby, making all possible
speed. So Elyot had nothing to do but to
follow, which he did smartly, keeping close at her
side.</p>

<p>“And they’ll be so s’prised to see us,” went on
Barby, growing confidential. “Oh, dear me! why
don’t their home ever come, I wonder.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we’re not half way there yet,” said Elyot
cheerfully; “it’s off that way, so,” waving his arm
down the winding road, “then it’s down this
way,” sweeping off in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” said Barby, with a small sigh
she could not suppress, “why is it so long, I
wonder? Won’t it come sooner?”</p>

<p>“You better give me your hand,” said Elyot,
looking down into the tired little face.</p>

<p>So Barby gave him her hand; and not caring
much where she planted her feet, she pattered unsteadily
on over the dusty road, letting Elyot do
all the talking.</p>

<p>Presently she said, “I’m tired, Elyot, truly I
am,” and tumbled down, a sleepy little heap, in a
thicket of blackberry-bushes.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t!” cried Elyot, pulling her
arm; “wake up, Barby. Mamsie wouldn’t like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
you to go to sleep here by the road.” But
Barby only hummed once, “I’m so tired, truly
I am;” and tucking her hand under her chin,
she fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Elyot looked up and down the road. There
was nobody in sight. It was too far to carry
her, that he knew from his recollection of the
distance as he had been taken there in the carriage.
Nevertheless, he got her somehow up in
his arms, and staggered off a few steps; but she
slipped out, and rolled up more of a heap than
ever on the ground.</p>

<p>At last he ran out into the middle of the road,
and watched for some one to come by; and as
no one appeared, he gathered up his small soul
with the best courage he could muster, and sat
down on a big stone by the side of the road.</p>

<p>“Some one has got to come by pretty soon,”
he said.</p>

<p>How long he waited no one knew. It seemed
to him hours, when, “Gee-lang—there, sho,
now,” struck upon his ears, and an old farmer
came around a bend in the road with a wagon-load
of grain.</p>

<p>Elyot got off his stone, and dashed over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
him on unsteady little legs. “Oh, say, Mr. Man!
please would you take us, my sister and me,
please?”</p>

<p>“Sho,” cried the farmer, pulling up his old
gray horse, “sho there—why, who be ye?”
staring at him.</p>

<p class="caption">Elyot gathered up his small soul with the best courage he could muster,

</figure>

<p>“Oh, please, Mr. Man, take us in your wagon!”
begged Elyot quickly, and not thinking it best
to answer any questions, “I’ll bring her;” and he
ran over to Barby. “Sit up now, you must;
there’s a good, kind man going to carry us in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
his wagon,” while the farmer rested his hands,
with the ends of the old leather reins, in his
lap, and scratched his shock of light hair in perplexity.</p>

<p>“We’re coming,” cried Elyot at last, tugging
Barby along. Her eyes were half closed, and
she protested every inch of the way, but he got
her up to the side of the wagon.</p>

<p>“Land o’ Goshen!” exclaimed the farmer,
jumping out, “I’ll help ye; there ye be.” He
picked Barby up, and lifted her over among the
grain-bags. “Curl up, now—she can sleep easy
as a kitten,” he said. Elyot had already clambered
up to the driver’s seat in great satisfaction;
so presently they were off, rattling down the turnpike.</p>

<p>“Wher’ ye goin’ to in Hingham?” at last asked
the farmer; “mebbe now ye want to be dropped
this side o’ th’ town?”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to be dropped at all,” cried
Elyot, hanging to the wagon-seat with both
hands. “Oh, please don’t drop us, Mr. Man!”
He glanced over his shoulder at Barby, peacefully
asleep, her head on a grain-bag.</p>

<p>“I mean, where d’ye want to be let out?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
Mebbe this side o’ th’ town,” explained the
farmer; “or shall I carry ye to Hingham?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t want to go to Hingham at all,”
said Elyot, hanging on for dear life.</p>

<p>The old farmer pulled up so suddenly that
despite his care, Elyot nearly fell out. “Don’t
want to go to Hingham!” he roared; “what did
ye ask me to take ye there for, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t!” said Elyot stoutly; “I asked
you to take us in your wagon. And you’re so
good, thank you, Mr. Man.”</p>

<p>“Well, an’ that’s the same thing; for my
wagon’s goin’ to Hingham; that’s where I live.
Where in thunder do you want to go, you an’
th’ girl?” he pointed with his thumb over his
shoulder to Barby.</p>

<p>“Oh! we want to go to see dear Mr. Beebe and
dear Mrs. Beebe, you know. We’ve been wanting
to go for a good many days; and Johnny couldn’t
come over to our house this morning, and everybody
was busy, so it was a good time;” Elyot
kept on talking, under the impression that the
farmer wouldn’t look so if conversation went on.</p>

<p>“Well, where’s Mr. Beebe live?” demanded
the farmer after an interval of despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Why, don’t you know? I know the place
just as easy,” exclaimed Elyot with a little laugh.</p>

<p>“Where is’t?”</p>

<p>“It’s down about there;” Elyot gave a wide
sweep to his arm, thereby almost knocking off
the farmer’s broad-brimmed straw hat; “and he
has such lots and lots of shoes”—as an after-thought.</p>

<p>“Shoes? be ye talkin’ of a shoe-shop?” asked
the farmer.</p>

<p>“Why, of course. I thought you knew that,”
remarked Elyot in disdain. “And dear Mr.
Beebe will say”—</p>

<p>“Never mind what he’ll say till he gets ye,”
said the farmer grimly. “Now, can’t ye remember
where that Mr. Beebe lives? I’ll be switched,
if I don’t b’lieve it’s Badgertown.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that’s it; of course he lives there,”
said Elyot, nodding furiously. “And please,
aren’t we most there? I like your wagon; but
we ought to hurry, ’cause Mr. and Mrs. Beebe
will ask us to dinner, and”—</p>

<p>“Land o’ Goshen, I am in a scrape!” exclaimed
the old farmer, slapping his knee with a dingy
hand. “Here I be with two young ones on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
hands, an’ don’t know no more’n one o’ them
what to do. An’ I can’t go clear back to them
shoe-shop Beebes, an’ I don’t durst go forrards.
Well, mebbe some one’ll heave along, who’s goin’
to Badgertown, an’ll take ’em.”</p>

<p>But no one “heaving along” for a good half-hour,
the old farmer was just about to turn his
old gray horse in despair, when an ancient gig
appeared, whose swaying top gave him a delicious
hope long before it came within talking distance;
and he cried joyfully, “Well, if this here ain’t
luck! Now, there’s Miss Sally an’ Belindy Scrannage
a-goin’ over to Badgertown of course.”</p>

<p>Long before the old gig got alongside the
wagon, the farmer had begun to shout out the
story; and by the time it was all over, Miss
Belinda, who wasn’t driving, had made a place
on the old leather seat between her sister and
herself; and sleepy little Barby being set thereon,
the small head was cuddled up against that lady’s
spencer waist, with one mitted hand put carefully
around the little figure to hold her close.</p>

<p>“You get up an’ set on that basket,” said Miss
Sally, who held the reins, and who was always
under the impression that the ancient horse was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
just going to run away. “It’s good we took the
flat-covered one to-day; ’twon’t hurt it; there’s
some garden-sass we’re a-carryin’ to our folks in
Badgertown. There, get up.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I sit on behind?” begged Elyot, who
didn’t view the basket with great affection. It
would be fine to swing his legs in freedom, instead
of being cooped up with the old ladies.</p>

<p>“No, you can’t,” said Miss Sally with authority;
“we might drop you off and never know it.
I’m a-goin’ to have you where I can see you.
Get in, an’ set still.”</p>

<p>“They’re to go to Mr. Beebe’s shoe-store, ye
know, on High Street,” roared the old farmer
after them from his high wagon.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, we’re goin’ right past there,” called
back Miss Sally in a thin, high voice, firmly
grasping the reins, and keeping an eye for danger
ahead. “Go easy there, Billy.”</p>

<p>Elyot, from his perch on the flat basket, with
his back to Billy, surveyed her carefully. He
could tell by the big mole on her chin that it was
no one whom he had ever seen before. He was
quite sure he should have remembered that mole;
and then he looked Miss Belinda over. Meantime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
he had to cling to the basket tightly; for
the cover, even though flat, was quite slippery,
and Billy had a way of putting his heels down
unexpectedly with a thud, and not always so
evenly as one ought to expect.</p>

<p>“Now, ain’t that a nice seat?” asked Miss
Sally briskly, when they had plodded along in
this fashion for a mile or so.</p>

<p>“No; I do not think it is,” said Elyot, hanging
on, and wishing he could turn around, or jump
out and rest his legs just once.</p>

<p>“Tush-tush! little boys shouldn’t be so free
with their tongues,” said Miss Sally, slapping
the reins smartly up and down Billy’s back.
“Land! when I was a little girl I always set in
front on a basket like that when pa and ma
took me ridin’.”</p>

<p>“Was it slippery?” asked Elyot, feeling a
little less miserable since some one would talk,
“just like this one?” patting it.</p>

<p>“Yes, just as like it as two peas. Sho, now,
Billy! An’ I remember when pa took me to
Cornwall Centre, and I never moved once on my
basket, but sat just as pretty. An’ I didn’t muss
my pelisse a mite. Don’t you remember their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
telling on’t when we got home, Belindy?” turning
to her sister in pride.</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” said Miss Belinda, with
a glance of veneration at the big square figure;
“an’ I know ma alwus said you were a proper
child to take away, Sally.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you ask to get down once, and just
stretch your legs just once?” asked Elyot, who
felt that the time had now arrived when he
must beg that favor.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, no!” said Miss Sally in horror.
“Why, that wouldn’t have been proper, child.
No, indeed, I just set pretty all the way.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br>

<small>AT THE BEEBES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN they turned the corner of High
Street, which was the former post-road
of the old town, and began to descend its somewhat
crooked slope, Elyot flew off from his basket,
and began to shout excitedly, “Oh, there it
is—there it is, oh, <i>please</i> stop!”</p>

<p>“Set down, child!” commanded Miss Sally
sharply; and gathering the leather reins in one
hand, she picked him energetically by the blouse.
Miss Belinda exclaimed faintly, “Oh, he’ll fall
out!” and put out her mitted fingers to help.</p>

<p>“You keep quiet, Belindy,” said Miss Sally
brusquely; “you got one child to look after; I’ll
see to this one. Now, set still,” to Elyot, “till
we get there. Then, goodness knows I’ll be glad
enough to let you out.”</p>

<p>Elyot tried to still his throbbing heart and
hang to the basket, craning his neck to watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
the Beebe shop, while Billy leisurely picked his
way over the cobble-stones.</p>

<p>“There, here you be!” exclaimed Miss Sally,
as at last they drew up in front of the little
shop, “to home; and, my land, I’m thankful
enough!”</p>

<p>Elyot was out over the wheel long before she
finished, and holding up his arms for Barby.</p>

<p>“That boy can’t carry her,” cried Miss Belinda
nervously from the depths of the gig;
“let me get out, Sally, and take her in.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Miss Sally, who knew
very well what settling Miss Belinda in again
would be; “she’ll wake up soon’s she’s on the
ground. And her folks’ll come out and get her.
Give her to me.”</p>

<p>With that she bundled Barby out, a sleepy
little heap, into Elyot’s outstretched arms. “Now,
run right along in to home,” she commanded;
and slapping the reins over Billy’s back, the gig
passed slowly down the street, Miss Belinda
working her spare figure around to apply her
eye to the square of dingy glass at the back.</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll get in safe,” she breathed
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Nonsense!” said Miss Sally again. “Well,
now, Belindy,” and she took up the interrupted
thread of their morning’s business, “I b’lieve we
better not take up this jell to Mrs. Jasper King’s
till afternoon. Seein’ we’re here, we better do a
mite o’ tradin’.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Miss Belindy meekly, who
would have said, “Very well” if the other way
had been proposed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Elyot, not taking one blissful moment
to stretch his legs, staggered over the uneven
pavement, and set Barby on the broad, flat doorstone.
Then he doubled up his little fist, being
too short to reach the old knocker, and too polite
to enter the shop without any summons at all,
and rapped with all his force on the green door.
Nobody coming, he propped Barby safely up
against the upper step so that she would not
fall over on her nose, and ran and peered into
the little window strung with shoes and boots
and rubbers of every description.</p>

<p>“Mr. Beebe!” he cried in a shrill little voice,
and plastering his face against the small panes
of glass, “oh, my dear Mr. Beebe, please let me
in!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Open the door, and go in, child,” said a good-natured
woman coming along; “folks don’t knock
when they’re going to th’ shop. Th’ knocker’s
for Sundays, when you’re goin’ to call.” With
that she reached over Barby, and threw wide the
door. “Mr. Beebe,” she called, “here’s somebody
wants to see you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me tell ’em first!” screamed Elyot, running
past her, and precipitating himself into a fat
old lady in a white cap with a good deal of pink
ribbon. “We’ve come all this way to see you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my good gracious me!” exclaimed Mrs.
Beebe, raising both hands in astonishment, then
clasping him close. “Pa! pa!” she screamed,
“here’s the little King boy come to see us! Is
your ma out there in the carriage?” all in the
same breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried Elyot, in the greatest pride;
“we came all alone by ourselfs—and Barby’s
out on the step;” and he dragged Mrs. Beebe
along by the apron.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Beebe, a good deal slower than he
used to be, came leaning on his cane, out from
the little room at the back, and over to the
green front door.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Well, now, my little dear,” he kept saying
all the way with a pleased smile, and beaming
kindly over his big silver spectacles, “that’s nice
to see you to-day.”</p>

<p>“You poor lamb, you,” Mrs. Beebe was saying
to Barby, and trying to lean over to lift her up,
“there, there, oh, you pretty creeter, you! Pa, I
don’t s’pose you can carry her. Oh, dear, I’m
such a stout old woman, an’ good for nothin’!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll get her in,” said Elyot, really afraid
that Mrs. Beebe would tumble over; and before
Mr. Beebe could remonstrate, he had lifted Barby,
and rolled her in over the sill, both of the Beebes
“ohing” and “ahing” all the time.</p>

<p>“Now, dear, there ain’t no manner o’ use in
askin’ you how you come,” said Mrs. Beebe, restraining
her curiosity, “the first thing to do is
to see after that poor lamb there. Do you s’pose,
Elyot, you could manage to get her onto the sofy,
an’ I’ll off with her shoes an’ bathe them poor
tired little feet. Oh, you poor lamb, you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can,” said Elyot manfully; and between
the help that old Mr. Beebe gave and old Mrs.
Beebe contributed, Barby was soon on the old
chintz sofa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Now, says I,” declared old Mr. Beebe, rubbing
his hands, “that’s something like it. I’ll
take off her shoes, wife, that’s in my line; an’
you get the hot water an’ bathe her feet.” So
he drew up a chair to the side of the sofa, and
putting Barby’s little dusty boots on his knee,
he drew them off, and the stockings; and Mrs.
Beebe, coming out with a big bowl, and a towel
over her arm, sat down in the chair that Elyot
drew up for her. “Oh, me! oh, my!” she exclaimed
compassionately, “the poor precious little
toes!” caressing them.</p>

<p>Elyot threw himself on the floor, and rolled
and stretched in perfect abandon.</p>

<p>“And he’s so tired too,” said old Mrs. Beebe,
stopping in her work to peer at him over her
spectacles.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” declared Elyot; “so awfully tired
sitting on a basket.”</p>

<p>“Sitting on a basket!” ejaculated both of the
Beebes together.</p>

<p>Elyot nodded, and took another roll.</p>

<p>Just then Barby pulled away the white toes
that Mrs. Beebe had submerged with the warm
cloth. “Oh!” she exclaimed, opening her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
dewy with sleep, and regarding them fixedly, “I
want some pink sticks for dinner; I’m hungry,
truly I am.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have one of the sugar doughnuts,
please,” said Elyot, now that his legs began to
feel better, finding that he was very hungry too.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Beebe laughed till his sides shook
and his spectacles tumbled off, and Mrs. Beebe
laughed too, and Elyot began to laugh, for he
was so comforted with it all, and he knew the
doughnuts were coming; and Barby laughed too,
and it was so very jolly, that no one heard a
customer come in, until he said rather gruffly,
“Is my boot half-soled, Mr. Beebe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bless you, yes!” said Mr. Beebe, getting
up and hobbling over to the other side of the
room, and he lifted a curtain that concealed a
shelf where the repaired articles were kept; “yes,
I had that done yist’day, Mr. Coombs,” he said,
bringing it out.</p>

<p>“You come along with me,” whispered old Mrs.
Beebe to Elyot, “an’ we’ll git the doughnuts.
Lucky I made a big lot yist’day; I must ’a’ known
you were comin’;” and she laughed again.</p>

<p>“And bring the pink sticks,” cried Barby after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
them. Then she leaned back on the old chintz
pillow, and gazed entranced at the beautiful rows
and rows of shoes dangling from strings across
the room, and strung across the little window.
And great green things, that afterward old Mr.
Beebe showed her were boxes that contained shoes
and rubbers; each had one of the articles hanging
to it. And there, on the top shelf of all, was a
long row of big rubber boots—oh, and it smelt
so very lovely! Barby lay quite still, and sniffed
and sniffed in delight. And even when a long
pink cinnamon stick was brought and put into
her chubby little hand, she held it loosely and
still gazed on.</p>

<p>“It’s a pink stick,” shouted Elyot at her, his
mouth full, and taking his face out from behind
a big doughnut.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it beautiful!” hummed Barby in delight.
“An’ oh! how do you do, my dear very own
Mrs. Beebe, and pretty well I thank you mostly,”
remembering her manners.</p>

<p>“She will say such dreadful things,” broke in
Elyot, quite mortified, notwithstanding his satisfaction;
“but you must excuse her, dear Mrs.
Beebe, ’cause she’s very little, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“You blessed dear!” cried old Mrs. Beebe,
quite overcome with admiration, and covering the
little round face with kisses till her cap-border
trembled.</p>

<p>“And I shall say just the very same thing to
dear Mr. Beebe,” declared Barby decidedly. Then
she began on her pink stick.</p>

<p>“There ain’t no mortal use askin’ them blessed
dears how they come here nor anythin’, till they
gits rested, Jotham,” said Mrs. Beebe, taking her
good man by the arm as the customer departed,
and whispering violently. “And my! they’re as
hungry—” she glanced around at them as she
spoke.</p>

<p>“They better ’a’ had somethin’ more solid ’n
candy,” said old Mr. Beebe, critically eying
them too.</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” cried old Mrs. Beebe, “I
wouldn’t ’a’ kept that blessed child from her
pink stick a minute more’n I could help. Look
at her suck it now!”</p>

<p>Barby’s face was wreathed in smiles, as she
lay on her back, in the fullest enjoyment of her
pink stick, that was rapidly melting, and adding
considerable of itself to the dust that the mud-pie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
baking and the travel had given her small
countenance.</p>

<p>“Time enough to give ’em somethin’ solid when
they’ve got what they wanted,” said the old lady
wisely. “Now, Jotham, we must let Mrs. King
know as soon as we can that them childern are
here. Think how she’s a-worritin’.”</p>

<p>“To be sure—to <i>be</i> sure!” exclaimed old Mr.
Beebe thoughtfully; “well, how’ll we do it, Sarah.
I can’t get down there, an’ now we don’t keep
no horse—well, I d’no what to do.”</p>

<p>“We must get some one to go for us,” said Mrs.
Beebe determinedly; and going to the door, she
peered anxiously up and down the street. “Now,
there’s them two old ladies who come over from
Hingham every week or so,—the Scrannages,—I
see their gig in front o’ Simons’s shop. I wonder
if they’d go for us. I mean to ask ’em.”</p>

<p>She untied her apron, and threw it over her
shoulders, it being more elegant than to go out
with nothing over her waist, and waddled down
the street.</p>

<p>The Misses Scrannage were selecting a new
calico dress apiece at Mr. Simons’s shop; and he
had taken them down to the extreme end, to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the beautiful new stock he had just gotten in.
They were now in a complete state of bewilderment,
not knowing whether or no to get a bright
pink with purple spots on it for Sally, as they
were afraid it wouldn’t wash, Mr. Simons solemnly
assuring them every minute in which there
was a lull in their consultations, that he knew for
an absolute certainty that it <i>couldn’t</i> fade. And
when this was decided and cut off, there was the
choosing of Miss Belinda’s gown. She had set
her heart on two shades of green worked in together,
with little white dots all over the whole.</p>

<p>“I know that won’t wash,” declared Miss Sally
scornfully; “an’ then how ’twill look when it
streaks,” she was saying as old Mrs. Beebe
stepped into the shop.</p>

<p>“It never’ll do to interrupt ’em when they’re
choosin’ caliker gownds,” said the old lady to
herself; “s’posin’ they shouldn’t get the right
ones, they’d blame me every blessed time they
put ’em on. Oh, dear me! I must wait; p’r’aps
they’re most through.”</p>

<p>But it was a good three-quarters of an hour
before Mr. Simons clicked his scissors through the
two pieces of calico, and they were torn off beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
recall. Every minute old Mrs. Beebe had
been on the point of rushing home, or rather
waddling, and had restrained herself, thinking
she heard the supreme moment of decision approaching.
“Pa knows where the cold meat, an’
the pies, an’ the bread is,” she comforted herself,
when she got nervous sitting on the wooden stool
they brought her to wait on. Now she hurried
as fast as she could down to the end of the
shop.</p>

<p>“How d’ye do, Miss Sally and Miss Belindy
Scrannage?” she said in her most polite way, “I
want to ask a gret favor;” trying to pull Miss
Sally, as the woman of business in the family,
aside, that no one might overhear.</p>

<p>“The little King children, Mrs. Jasper King’s,
are at my house. Poor things! they must ’a’
walked clear down here, when no one knew it,
and”—</p>

<p>“I brung ’em in our gig,” proclaimed Miss
Sally in a loud voice. “Oh, my land, an’ good
gracious me!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“OH, now,” cried King joyfully, “I can go
and play with Elyot and Barby!” He
sprang up, and began to skip to the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, dear!” said Phronsie gently; “you
had three words spelled badly, you know. That
column must be right, and then you can go.”</p>

<p>“O sister Phronsie!” King began to whine.
And then he grumbled, “I wish there weren’t
any lessons in the world. I just hate ’em, I
do.”</p>

<p>Joel thrust his head in the doorway. “May
I come in?” he asked Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” she said with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, well, King,” he said, going over to the
little desk, and laying his hand on it, “do you
know I said just those words you’ve used, once
to Mamsie; and I wish I could forget it.”</p>

<p>“You said you hated books!” repeated King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
in amazement, and forgetting to cry, a thing he
had just made up his mind to do. “Why, you
know just everything.”</p>

<p>“Not quite that,” said Joel, bursting into a
laugh; “but I know considerably more because
of what Mamsie said to me then.”</p>

<p>“And what did Mamsie say?” asked King,
intensely interested, and leaning across his little
desk.</p>

<p>“She said study didn’t amount to much unless
one was glad of the chance, and that she would
stick to it if she had to work herself to skin
and bone. I tell you, King, that just about killed
me for Mamsie to have to tell me that.”</p>

<p>King drew a long breath. “Do you s’pose
she’d have to say so to me, if she was here
now?” he asked presently.</p>

<p>“I verily do,” said Joel, with a keen glance
out of his black eyes that looked so very like his
mother’s, that King quailed immediately. “I’ll—I’ll
study, brother Joel,” he said, reaching for
the neglected spelling-book.</p>

<p>Joel gave him a pat on his stubby head.
“Good for you,” he said.</p>

<p>Outside, Alexia was saying to Amy Loughead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
in the hall, “Oh! no use to try to get a squint
at Phronsie in the morning till ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“What is she doing?” asked Amy.</p>

<p>“Oh! she hears King’s lessons for an hour, and
studies with him; he’s her care, you know, while
Mrs. Fisher is away. But she might slip off a
few minutes once in a while, and he’d study by
himself. But horses can’t drag her away till the
hour is up.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Amy slowly, “I shouldn’t think
they could.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” said Alexia, remembering Polly’s
frightful trials with her little music-scholar.
Then she added kindly, “Oh! of course not; but
we do want her just awfully this morning. We’re
going to have a driving-party down to the Glen;
and of course no one can do anything without
Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Oh! of course not,” said Amy.</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t make that tiresome clock go
ahead any faster,” observed Alexia, “to watch
it,” tearing off her gaze from the tall clock in
an angle of the hall, “so I’m going off to find
Cathie.”</p>

<p>Amy sat down in a niche by the window, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
busied herself with a little book she drew out of
her pocket. How long she read she did not know,
but King rushed past in a whirlwind of delight.
“Phronsie said I could go! Hooray!” and
Phronsie came out into the hall, followed by
Joel.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Phronsie, “we must hurry and get
up the Glen driving-party. Joel, please see that
Johnson understands that the horses are brought
around for those who are to ride. And, O Joel!
please see that the drag is ready, and my cart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! and the trap, and the whole list of
them. You ride Firefly, Phronsie, of course; and
I’m going to take one of the black horses, Polly
said I could, and ride with you.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Phronsie; “Grace Tupper is to ride
Firefly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Phron!” protested Joel.</p>

<p>“I asked her to,” said Phronsie. “She used
to ride a good deal, and she hasn’t had a chance
for a long while. I want her to, Joel.”</p>

<p>“Any other time would do just as well,” began
Joel. But Phronsie looked at him, and he hastened
to add, “But of course it’s just as you
please. Well, then, I shall drive you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Yes, so you may,” cried Phronsie, well pleased,
“and Amy too. Take us both, Joel, do.” She
put her arm around the young girl affectionately.</p>

<p>Joel suppressed what he felt, and said, “All
right,” and was just rushing out, when in ran
King.</p>

<p>“Phronsie, where are Elyot and Barby?”</p>

<p>“Just over the east terrace,” said Phronsie.
“I saw them a little while ago when you were
at your lesson.”</p>

<p>“Well, they aren’t there now,” declared King
in an injured tone. “Now, I know they meant to
run away from me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, King dear!” said Phronsie, putting a
gentle hand on his hot face.</p>

<p>“Well, where are they, then?” demanded King
wrathfully.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and hunt for them,” said Phronsie
merrily. “Come, Amy, let us find those babies.”</p>

<p>So Amy Loughead and Phronsie picked up their
skirts and sped over the terraces, King racing on
ahead, all three calling, “Bar-<i>by</i>! Ely-<i>ot</i>!” at
the top of their voices.</p>

<p>“There, they aren’t here, you can see for yourself,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
said King, turning a hot and flushed face
upon them after a while.</p>

<p>“No,” said Phronsie, the pink color deserting
her cheek, “I see they are not, King.” Then, as
he began to look frightened, she brightened up,
and said cheerily, “Do you run up to the house,
Amy dear, and get the horn from Mrs. Higby;
then, King, you shall blow it, and that’ll surely
bring them back.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get brother Joel first,” cried
King, scampering off in the direction of the
stables.</p>

<p>“And tell him to set Patsy to hunting on the
grounds,” called Phronsie after him.</p>

<p>But despite the vigorous horn-blowing presently
set up, King puffing out his cheeks with
all his might, and Patsy and two or three of the
other stable-men scouring the grounds, headed by
Joel; and notwithstanding that Phronsie and Amy
ran hither and thither spreading the alarm, till
Polly and nearly all the guests in the house were
just so many searching-parties, exploring the little
brown house and every other place that would be
likely to attract the children, no trace of the two
children could be found. And King threw himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
disconsolately into Phronsie’s arms, crying as
if his heart would break.</p>

<p>Miss Salisbury was up on the front veranda;
she so far forgot herself as to wring her hands,
when she thought no one observed her.</p>

<p>“O Miss Salisbury!” cried Amy Loughead, running
up, “will you be so very good as to tell Aunt
Montgomery that I’m going down the road to
hunt for the children. I may not be back, you
know, for some time.”</p>

<p>“Hey, what’s that?” cried Robert Bingley,
sauntering along the side veranda. He was waiting
for the assembling of the driving-party, and
hadn’t heard a word of the bad news.</p>

<p>“The two children are lost,” said Amy briefly,
before she ran off.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar’s ghost!” cried Robert Bingley.
“Excuse me, Miss Salisbury,” as he now saw
her; and clearing the veranda railing with one
bound, he struck off for the group on the lawn.
Just below lay the deserted mud-pies and the
two little trowels.</p>

<p>Meantime Amy, gathering up her skirts with
one shaking hand, skipped down the road, only
one feeling uppermost in her heart,—to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Polly’s children. “I must, or I shall die,” sobbed
Amy to herself, the tears splashing over her
pretty blue lawn gown.</p>

<p>An old scissors-grinder came down the road,
ringing his bell violently. “Oh, sir!” cried Amy,
rushing up at him, “have you seen two little
children, a boy and a girl? they’re lost, and we
don’t know where to find them.” She wrung her
hands now, and cried all over her dress.</p>

<p>“Hey?” cried the scissors-grinder.</p>

<p>“Oh! please, sir, do tell me if you have seen
them,” begged Amy.</p>

<p>“I’m deef,” said the scissors-grinder, “and I
don’t know what you’re saying, Miss;” and he
put his hand behind his ear, and opened his
mouth, as if in that way his hearing might be
improved. So Amy got up on tiptoe, and shouted
it all into his ear; and he shook his head, and
declared he hadn’t seen a child on the road that
morning, and he had just come from Badgertown
Centre.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he said. “I’ll ring
my bell, and then I’ll cry, ‘Child lost’—no, ‘two
children lo-ost,’ and then everybody’ll know it,
and look out for ’em.” So he went on, ringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and jingling, and calling it out, while she flew
down along the road.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any use in your doing this,” said
a voice back of her as she sped along; and Robert
Bingley dashed up in a dog-cart. “Here, Miss
Loughead, jump in, and we’ll search for those
two kids together.”</p>

<p>“They’re Polly’s children,” announced Amy, as
if stating a wholly new fact, and turning her sorrowful
face, down which the tears were chasing,
to him; “and it will just kill her, Mr. Bingley, if
they’re not found.”</p>

<p>“Jump in,” said Mr. Bingley, extending his
hand to help her; “excuse my not getting out, but
this horse is bound to go. There, now,” as she
was seated, “which way, of all the ways in the
universe, would those children be likely to take—that’s
the question. Then I should take the
other.”</p>

<p>“The scissors-man said he hadn’t seen a child
on this road; and he has just come from Badgertown,”
said Amy.</p>

<p>“I saw you interviewing him,” said Robert
Bingley. “Well, as that remarkably stupid individual
did give utterance to that fact, I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
state my private opinion to be that those children
took this very road. He’s too stupid to know a
child when he sees it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bingley,” cried Amy, all the color deserting
her cheek, and in her sudden terror she seized
his arm, “oh, I’ve just thought—there’s the pond,
you know.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know,” said Bingley, distressed at
her fright, but outwardly as cool as ice.</p>

<p>“Why, Spot Pond, they call it,” said Amy with
a little gasp. “Phronsie was telling me about it—what
a pretty place it was, and how they would
take me fishing there, and”—</p>

<p>“Were the children about so that they heard
you?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes—no, I believe not,” she said, racking
her brain to remember; “but they may have gone
there just the same.”</p>

<p>“Where is it, do you know?” asked Bingley,
slackening speed a little.</p>

<p>“It’s on this road. After you get by the schoolhouse,
then turn to the right—that is, it’s just a
little off the road,” said Amy; “she told me all
about it at the breakfast-table. O Mr. Bingley,
do let us go there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“There’s the schoolhouse,” said Bingley, spying
it a little distance away; “so as the pond is a
short bit away, we better try it, instead of going
home for assistance.” He gave the whip to the
pony, and off they spun.</p>

<p>But Spot Pond was still and lovely and serene.
Not a ripple disturbed its clear surface, and only
a cat-bird screamed at them overhead.</p>

<p>“They couldn’t have walked clear down here by
this time,” said Robert Bingley; “besides, there
are no little boot-tracks anywhere.” Amy clasped
her hands tightly together.</p>

<p>“Now I shall interview the schoolmarm,” said
Robert Bingley, driving back; and rapping on the
schoolhouse door, he brought out the teacher, book
in hand, and a fringe of scholars, older and
younger, around her.</p>

<p>“No,” she said to his question; “we haven’t
any of us seen any little children. Have you,”
turning to some big boys who sat by the window,
“seen any go by?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” they said; and Bingley, feeling sure
that nothing could have escaped a boy at such a
vantage-ground, set his teeth together hard, and
turned irresolutely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>Amy Loughead now sat up quite straight. “Oh!
I can’t go home, Mr. Bingley,” she said, “and see
Polly, and not take the children to her. Please
take me into the town, and I’ll ask everybody
there, in all the shops, and along the streets and
houses. Somebody must know.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” said Robert Bingley, whipping
up, “and at least your plan has action in it;
and I confess myself that I don’t want to go home
either without something to show for it.”</p>

<p>It was well past midday when Amy, who
had asked at every farmhouse and each smarter
residence within the village itself, now began
to traverse the High Street, where all the shops
were crowded together as a trading centre. Bingley
had begged to get out and do this for her;
but she had refused so decidedly, and plodded
on so persistently, that he was forced to obey
her, and he watched her little figure and pale,
set face, compassionately. She had just asked
at the milliner’s, gay with its spring and summer
ribbons and flowers, and smart in the perky
hats adorning the big window, and had turned
away despairingly, going into the neighboring
shops, and asking the same question, to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
everybody sad and anxious to help, when they
knew Mr. Jasper King’s children were lost. Mechanically
she turned up the next step of a little
shop, wedged in between two taller ones, and
having on the sign above the green door,—</p>

<p>“Have you seen,” she began, with no hope
of success, “two little”—and there was Barby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
in a little wooden chair, eating bread and butter
with a very sticky face, while Elyot was
capering around the small shop on a cane, an
old man with big silver spectacles laughing to
see him go.</p>

<small>HOME AGAIN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE “Scrannage girls,” as their neighbors
called them, were seated in high-back chairs
in the big hall at “The Oaks;” their gig, in
which they had followed as best they could the
swift pony-cart bearing home the children, was
tied at the end of the carriage-drive. They had
cups of tea in their hands, from which they drew
long draughts of inspiration and refreshment to
help along their part of the tale.</p>

<p>Polly sat down in front of them on a low
cushioned seat, clasping her baby in her arms,
and Elyot crouched on the floor, his arms in
his mother’s lap; the rest of the household and
guests crowding up for the recital, old Mr. King
at the visitors’ right hand, and Amy Loughead
modestly selecting the background.</p>

<p>“Ye see,” said Miss Sally, who as usual was
spokeswoman, “it was jest this way. We made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
up our minds to go to town this mornin’; one
thing on account o’ bringin’ you the jell you’d
ordered, marm,” bobbing her large bonnet at Mrs.
King.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly. “Well, and where did you
meet the children, Miss Scrannage?” clasping
Barby very closely.</p>

<p>“I was a-goin’ to tell you. Land! but this tea
is proper good, Mis’ King,” taking a long draught
of it, and smacking her lips. “Well, we made up
our minds to come to town as I was a-sayin’.”</p>

<p>“My good woman,” said Mr. King, “we do not
care for all those particulars. What we do want
to know is where you met those children?”
pointing to Elyot and Barby.</p>

<p>Miss Sally Scrannage turned her large face and
looked at him. Wasn’t she a Scrannage of Hingham,
Jabez Scrannage’s daughter? and was she
going to be put down that way, even if this was
the great Mr. King, and he worth his millions?
She set down her teacup, and gathered up the
crumbs of cake carefully in a little heap in her
napkin before she was ready to open her mouth.
Phronsie stepped softly out of the group, and
going up to the two old ladies, she laid her hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
gently on the big, square shoulder, “Don’t you
understand, dear Miss Scrannage,” she said, “that
we are all so anxious to know at once, just as
soon as we possibly can, when you first saw the
children. Their poor mother cannot bear to
wait.”</p>

<p>Miss Sally followed the hand that pointed to
Polly. When she saw the tears on the cheek
usually so bright, her own face softened, and her
battle feathers, so to speak, drooped. “And I’ll
tell you quick’s I can, my dear,” she said, “seein’
you ask so pretty. But I ain’t accustomed to be
spoke to like a dog, an’ ordered ’round, you know.
Let’s see; ’twas after we’d got by the Hammatt
place, Belindy, warn’t it, when we saw Abiel Babbidge
driv up by the side o’ the road, an’ he a-settin’
still, an’ his horse not movin’ a hoof, an’ sez
I—you remember what I sez, Belindy, says I”—</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Babbidge have the children in his
wagon?” asked Phronsie, still standing by her
side.</p>

<p>“Yes, he did; we was quite a piece by the
Hammatt place.”</p>

<p>“A <i>good</i> piece,” said Miss Belinda.</p>

<p>“Yes, just as I say, a good piece.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“How far is the Hammatt place from here?
Ask her, Phronsie,” said old Mr. King.</p>

<p>“How many miles do you think the Hammatt
place is from here, Miss Scrannage?” asked
Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Well, I d’no. It might be six mile, and then
again it might be five. I hain’t heard folks say.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mr. King.</p>

<p>“Well, Jabez he was a-sittin’ stock still as a
stun, an’ it scart me. I didn’t know but what
he was dead. If it had ’a’ been cold weather, I
should suppose he’d fruz. And I says to him,
says”—</p>

<p>“Where did he say he found the children?”
asked Phronsie.</p>

<p>“I was a-comin’ to that,” said Miss Sally
shortly; and picking up her tea again, she took
a good swallow. “Well, Jabez he says to me,
he says, ‘Get these childern home, will ye, Miss
Scrannage?’ I’m very sure he said home, ain’t
you, B’lindy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember,” said Miss Belinda.</p>

<p>Miss Sally tossed her a look of scorn. “Well,
I do,” she sniffed. “He says, ‘Get these childern
home, will ye, Miss Scrannage, down to Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Beebe’s shoe-shop?’ An’ sister an’ me said of
course we would; an’ he an’ I got the childern
in, an’”—</p>

<p>“And she put me on a slippery basket, and I
couldn’t see the horse,” said Elyot; “and I didn’t
like it!”</p>

<p>“O Elyot!” said his mother gently, patting his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
head; “just think how kind dear Miss Sally was.
You couldn’t have gotten home without her,
dear.”</p>

<p>Elyot grunted feebly something that was inaudible,
especially as Miss Sally, much mollified by
Mrs. King’s words, proceeded,—</p>

<p>“So B’lindy took care of the little girl,”—Polly
glanced over with a smile at “sister’s”
meek face,—“an’ I had the wust, ’cause I had to
drive, an’ I had that boy. Well, an’ we went fust
of all to the shoe-shop. I was a-comin’ here with
the jell fust, but then I thought, bein’ you said
you warn’t”—</p>

<p>“Oh! I didn’t need the jelly,” said Polly hastily;
“thank you for going to Mr. Beebe’s first.”</p>

<p>“An’ I jest let the childern out, of course, as
I s’posed ’twas their home, an’ that’s all I know,
’cept that old Mis’ Beebe run in to Simons’s with
an apun over her head,—we was tradin’, gettin’
some new calikers, you know,” said Miss Sally
in an important way, “an’”—</p>

<p>“She asked you to let us know, did she?”
asked Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Yes, she did; an’ then I told her I was the
one that brung them childern to her shop, an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
then we heard a squeal, an’ that boy there,”
pointing her long finger at Elyot, “come runnin’
in the shop, an’ said he’d come to bid old Mis’
Beebe good-by, and the little girl come along too,
an’ he said they’d sent for ’em to come home
right away, an’ he was a-comin’ again some time—but
I know one thing, an’ that is, that I won’t
bring him.”</p>

<p>“Sally, Sally,” ventured Miss Belinda in a
shocked tone.</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Scrannage,” cried Polly, rushing
out of her seat, and clinging to Barby, while
Elyot dragged after, clutching her gown, “and
dear Miss Belinda, you don’t know how grateful
I am to you for all your lovely care of my little
ones. I wish—oh, how I wish my husband was
home to thank you too! Oh! we never can repay
you.” She took their withered and hard hands
in her soft, warm ones.</p>

<p>“And I’d like to kiss you,” said Barby, putting
up her rosy lips, “anyway her—I would like to
kiss her,” pointing to Miss Belinda, who was
blushing like a winter apple, and beaming at her.</p>

<p>“No, we never can repay you,” repeated Polly
out of a full heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>Miss Sally received all this with the greatest
satisfaction, but her cup of happiness was quite
full when Grandpapa got deliberately out of his
chair and advanced to her.</p>

<p>“And you mustn’t mind what an old fellow
says, Miss Scrannage,” he said, holding out his
hand with a courtly bow. “Goodness me, my
dear woman, can you guess what we’ve suffered
when those blessed babies couldn’t be found?
And so shake hands, and forgive whatever you
didn’t like in my words.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll forgive!” said Miss Scrannage, putting
out her toil-worn hand with just as much
pride; “an’ mebbe I hadn’t orter been so quick
myself; but I can’t help it, for I’ve got it from
the Scrannage side o’ th’ house, an’ it’s hard to
pull up. Well, now, B’lindy, seein’ all’s comfortable,
we better be a-goin’. We’re goin’ to stay
all night, ye know,” she said, addressing the
company, “down to our cousin’s in town; but we
got to go to one or two more o’ th’ shops, an’
then we want to visit some before supper.”</p>

<p>Mr. King did not dare to interrupt; but he
kept fingering his pocket-book nervously, well
concealed as it was. His eyes sought Phronsie’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
face and Polly’s, and finding no encouragement
in either, he cleared his throat, “Hem! well, now,
Miss Scrannage, I don’t want to hinder you; but
what sort of a man is this Mr. Babbidge, I believe
you said his name was, that gave the children
to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he’s a good sort o’ man, ’Biel Babbidge
is,” replied Miss Sally, “dretful poor he is,
an’”—</p>

<p>“Poor, is he?” cried old Mr. King with interest.</p>

<p>“Land, yes! never was forehanded; couldn’t be,
with that sick wife of his.”</p>

<p>“Is she sick?” asked Phronsie pityingly.</p>

<p>“Yes; hain’t done a hand’s turn for a year,
with rheumatiz, an’ before that ’twas newmony,
an’ before that”—</p>

<p>“Poor man!” said Polly; “of course he couldn’t
get along, with a sick wife.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented Miss Sally; “an’ he
hain’t got along; has to hire whatever help he
gets in the house. He’s dretful good to his wife;
sets a store by her, an’ treats her jest like a baby.
She was a Potter, lived down to th’”—</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Scrannage,” said old Mr. King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
desperately, and bringing the pocket-book out to
the surface, “I want to reward somebody for all
their goodness to me and to my family in bringing
our children home. Do help me to do it.”</p>

<p>“You better give it to ’Biel Babbidge, then,”
said Miss Sally with a stiffening in her back, as
she looked in his eyes. Then she glanced at
her sister, who straightened herself involuntarily.
“Land, yes! he’s dretful poor, an’ needs it.”
She stepped out of her chair with the air of
being able to buy up all Badgertown. “Come,
B’lindy, we reelly must be a-goin’. I thank you
for that cup o’ tea, Mis’ King; ’twas reel pa’ticler
good, and you, Miss Phronsie, thank you. Good-day,”
with an old-time courtesy to the company.</p>

<p>Elyot rushed after her. “I’m sorry I said
that about the basket,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Phronsie, as they all turned back
and went slowly over the lawn, the whole company
having escorted the old ladies to their carriage,
the gentlemen vying in their attentions, and
David securing the honor of unhitching Billy,
“why cannot we take our driving-party over to
Hingham to-morrow, instead of to the Glen, and
see Mr. and Mrs. Babbidge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“And do up the business with them,” finished
old Mr. King. “The very thing, Phronsie,” with
a grateful smile at her. “I only wish I could
wind up my debt to that Miss Scrannage as
easily,” he groaned.</p>

<p>“O Phronsie!” cried Polly ecstatically; “that’s
a lovely plan. Oh, you dear, for thinking of it!”</p>

<p>And every one of the company thereupon expressed
their great delight. Suddenly Elyot
glanced down the road. “Oh, I see papa!” he
howled; “he’s on top of the stage.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, what is the whole family drawn
up here in parade for?” cried Jasper, swinging
himself down from Mr. Tisbett’s side. And
“O Jasper! what has brought you so early?”
from Polly. And then all the story had to be
gone over and over, with many things interspersed
by Elyot and Barby, who felt that half
enough attention had not been paid to the Beebes,
and who clamored for every one to hear what a
splendid time they’d had in the little shop.</p>

<p>“And I sat in the little chair that Aunt Phronsie
sat in,” cried Barby. “Truly I did, papa,”
pulling his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Yes, she did,” said Elyot; “the same little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
wooden chair that Aunt Phronsie sat in when
she got her red-topped shoes; Mr. Beebe said so.
And I had doughnuts—all I wanted.”</p>

<p>Polly viewed him in alarm, while Joel smacked
his lips. “We remember those doughnuts, don’t
we, Dave,” poking the college instructor in the
ribs.</p>

<p>And then they all hurried in, Jasper’s arm
around Polly, while his children hung to his hand;
for he had brought out a new piece of music he
wanted to try with Polly before dinner.</p>

<p>On the way to the music-room, Joel picked up
a little book from one of the window-niches in the
big hall. “Whose is this?” he asked, carelessly
whirling the leaves of a Greek poem.</p>

<p>“That’s Miss Loughead’s, I believe,” said Robert
Bingley, who stood next, and looking over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” exclaimed Joel impulsively.
“What, belong to that little thing! Why, man
alive, she never knew enough to understand that
there was such a book.” And then he turned and
met Amy Loughead’s blue eyes.</p>

<small>SOME HINGHAM CALLS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“PHRONSIE,” said Joel desperately, “I can’t
take Miss Loughead with us.”</p>

<p>“O Joey! you promised,” said Phronsie in a
grieved way.</p>

<p>“But I can’t do it—do beg off for me some
way. Why, it’s impossible for me to look the
girl in the face after what I’ve said. How I
could ever have spoken so, I don’t see,” went
on Joel remorsefully.</p>

<p>Phronsie was about to say something; but
thinking better of it, she only smiled comfortingly.</p>

<p>“Do, will you, Phronsie?” begged Joel in a
wheedling way.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to take Amy all the more
because you did speak so, Joel,” said Phronsie
quietly, “so I cannot speak for you, dear.”</p>

<p>Joel turned off, and ground his boot into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
gravel. “All right, Phronsie,” he said, turning
around.</p>

<p>But just here Grandpapa came around the
curve in the path. “Phronsie, you will drive
me in your cart,” he said.</p>

<p>“Shall I, Grandpapa?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear; and tell Johnson to put my bay
in.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpapa.” Phronsie looked at Joel.
His black eyes said, just as when a boy he had
been delighted at anything, “Oh, goody! now
I sha’n’t have to drive that girl to Hingham.”</p>

<p>Phronsie answered the look by, “O Joel! now
it will help to make up for what you said; as
you can take Amy Loughead over alone, and
that’ll show her you are sorry.”</p>

<p>Joel’s face lengthened. “Really, Phronsie?”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Phronsie; then she ran off to
get ready.</p>

<p>“Miss Loughead,” said Joel awkwardly, going
into the music-room where she stood alone,
turning over some of Polly’s music, “I don’t
know as you’ll go with me—I’m sure I shouldn’t,
if the cases were reversed; but I was to take
my sister Phronsie and you on the driving-party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
to the Glen yesterday, you know.” He paused,
having come to the length of his chain, and stared
helplessly at her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Amy.</p>

<p>“Well, now it’s Hingham, instead; and Grandpapa
wants Phronsie to go with him, so it leaves
you and me out in the cold,” he said with an attempt
at a laugh.</p>

<p>Amy said nothing, so he had to plunge on.
“And if you’ll be willing under the circumstances
to let me drive you, why, I’ll do it,” finished Joel
desperately.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to, Mr. Pepper?” asked Amy,
raising a pair of clear blue eyes to his, “because
do not really try to do it—to—make up—for
anything. I’d rather you didn’t,” she said earnestly.</p>

<p>“I do wish it,” said Joel heartily, “if you are
willing—that’s the question. Miss Loughead, I
never was so sorry in all my life for anything,”
he declared; and he hung his head, wishing he
were small enough to be whipped, and be done
with it.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel distressed about it,” said Amy.
“I was a little goose, Mr. Pepper, in the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
days; and I just wasted my time, and I wouldn’t
study; and I worried Polly dreadfully.” It was
now her turn to look distressed, and Joel cried
out, “Don’t look so, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>“And you were quite right in believing I
couldn’t, or I wouldn’t, study now,” said Amy.
“I don’t blame you, Mr. Pepper.” She put out
her hand, which Joel seized remorsefully.</p>

<p>“Will you go?” he cried eagerly, and hanging
to it,—“will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go,” said Amy Loughead, pulling
away her hand, and smiling brightly.</p>

<p>“Oh, beg pardon!” ejaculated Joel, backing
off, “I was thinking it was Phronsie.” Then
in hurried Robert Bingley.</p>

<p>“Miss Loughead, I’ve been looking everywhere
for you. May I have the pleasure of driving
you to Hingham this morning?”</p>

<p>“I am going with Mr. Joel Pepper,” said
Amy. And Joel heard his friend Bingley say,
“Whew!” and he meant to have it out with
him some time for that.</p>

<p>At last they were off,—Mrs. Higby, shading
her eyes with her hand, watched them from the
upper door,—all but Jasper, who went as usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
with the “little publishing bag” to town in the
early train. The children were distributed evenly
throughout the party on the drag; Polly and
Grace Tupper, Ben and David were on horseback;
and Grandpapa and Phronsie led off in
the dog-cart merrily; while Joel and Amy Loughead
brought up the rear, the interval being
filled by a big beach-wagon. When Robert Bingley
found how it was, he clambered into this
last, without a sign on his face that he didn’t
choose that place to begin with.</p>

<p>“Well, really,” observed Percy, adjusting his
monocle with importance, “this road looks exactly
like all country roads—don’t you know.”</p>

<p>Van, on the back seat with Gladys Ray,
grinned. “Astonishing fact,” he whispered to
her. “It’s his monocle that does that.”</p>

<p>“Polly wouldn’t like it to have you make fun
of your brother,” she said.</p>

<p>Van colored up to the roots of his light hair.
“I’m glad you’re going to be like Polly, Gladys,”
he said, “and keep me straight.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I’m not going to keep you straight,”
she cried with spirit; “you’ve got to keep yourself
straight. But I shall say things that I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
heard the Peppers say, for it’s good for you to
hear them.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this fine,” cried David, riding up to
the side of the trap—“eh, Joe? Doesn’t it take
you back to the days when we used to race barefoot
along this Hingham road?”</p>

<p>“That it does,” cried Joel, in huge delight, and
raised back to his self-esteem by the quiet poise
of the girl beside him, who evidently meant to
take everything as it had been before his cruel
and unlucky speech. “She’s one girl in a thousand
for sense and a good heart,” said Joel to
himself many times on the drive. “Nobody else
but Polly and Phronsie could have done it.”</p>

<p>When they reached Hingham, as they did in
good time, it was an easy matter to find Abiel
Babbidge’s house. Everybody knew him, and
could tell the old yellow house, run down at the
heel, as it were, set back from the side road. All
around it lay one of the New England farms,
whose principal crop seemed to be stones, which,
if removed, would leave not much else. “Good
gracious me!” ejaculated old Mr. King, as Phronsie
turned the bay up the scraggly wagon-path to
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>The whole procession came to a halt. “Phronsie,”
said Grandpapa, “you’d better ask to see
Mrs. Babbidge. I’ll tackle him if he is home.”</p>

<p>“Shall I, Grandpapa?” asked Phronsie, getting
out.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me!” howled Elyot, trying to spring
off from the drag. “I want to see my nice Mr.
Babbidge.”</p>

<p>“And me too,” cried Barby; “let me too!”</p>

<p>King was consumed with envy, and so was
Johnny Fargo, because they had no former acquaintance
to plead. “I wouldn’t,” he said, laying
a restraining hand on Elyot’s jacket.</p>

<p>“You let me alone,” cried Elyot crossly, and
twitching himself free. “You don’t know my
Mr. Babbidge. Oh, <i>do</i> let me get down!”</p>

<p>“So you shall, dear,” said Polly, riding up to
the side of the drag, “and Barby. Run along
now, chickens,” as somebody lifted Barby down
and set her on the ground, “and call your Mr.
Babbidge out. We all want to see him.”</p>

<p>Thereupon King and Johnny screamed for permission
to get down, which being accorded, they
whooped off also, and disappeared around the
house in the direction of the dilapidated barn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>Presently Abiel Babbidge appeared, shambling
and shamefaced, with one of the King children
hanging to either hand,—the other boys trying
to catch on somewhere, and not succeeding very
well.</p>

<p>Polly reined her horse up to his side. “How
do you do, Mr. Babbidge?” she said, putting out
her dainty riding-glove. “I am the children’s
mother, and I want to thank you for all the kind
care you gave them yesterday.”</p>

<p>“O Moses and Methuselah!” exclaimed Abiel
Babbidge, startled out of any sort of manners;
“ye be! Why, I can’t tech ye’re hand with
this.” He extricated one of his horny palms
from Barby’s grasp, and held it up to her.</p>

<p>Polly shook it warmly. “I cannot thank you,
Mr. Babbidge, as I want to. May I see your
wife?” and she rode up to the old horse-block
and dismounted.</p>

<p>Abiel Babbidge’s face fell. “My wife is sick,”
he said slowly, and something like a tear fell
from his eye. Elyot pulled away his hand, and
looked up in astonishment at him.</p>

<p>“I know she is not well,” said Polly gently;
“but I thought perhaps you would think she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
see me and my sister,” taking Phronsie’s hand.
“But not if you do not think best, Mr. Babbidge.”</p>

<p>“Ye may,” said Mr. Babbidge abruptly. “I
declar to gracious I sh’d be glad to have her see
ye both. ’Twould bring her right up, mebbe.”</p>

<p>Old Mr. King got slowly out of the dog-cart
while Mr. Babbidge was escorting Polly and
Phronsie in. On the top step, Polly turned and
said softly, “Now run away, children, and don’t
make a noise under the window.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re going in!” cried Elyot, pushing
with all his might to get in first.</p>

<p>“Mamma says not,” said Polly; and they
tumbled back quickly, and swarmed into the dog-cart
to wait with Grandpapa.</p>

<p>In a few minutes out came Mr. Babbidge’s
head and shoulders in the doorway. “They want
ye,” he nodded to old Mr. King; who, mightily
pleased to be summoned, wended his way to the
steps.</p>

<p>“Somebody come and sit with those youngsters,”
he cried, shaking his walking-stick at the
bunch of them in the cart. So Ben got out of
the drag, and ran up just in time to save the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
bay from getting a smart thwack from the whip
that Johnny Fargo had captured.</p>

<p>“The next boy that gets hold of that whip
will tumble out of this cart,” said Ben decidedly.</p>

<p>Polly sat by the side of the bed in the old bedroom
that opened out of the kitchen, Phronsie
stood by the foot, as Abiel Babbidge said to Mr.
King, “There’s my wife, sir,” and pointed to the
bed. Under the old patched bedquilt she lay,
propped up by pillows; everything marvellously
neat, but oh, so coarse and poor! She had a smile
on her thin face; and her hand, all drawn up with
rheumatism, was extended in simple courtesy of
an old-time pattern.</p>

<p>“Oh! how do you do, madam?” said old Mr.
King much shocked, and for the life of him not
knowing what to say.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Babbidge knew no embarrassment.
She asked her husband to get some more chairs
from the kitchen and bring in; and when he,
big and awkward, knocked down more things in
the carrying out of this request than he could
pause to pick up, she passed it serenely over, and
smiled at him just the same.</p>

<p>Polly felt the tears in her eyes, in spite of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
her efforts to keep them out. “Dear Mrs. Babbidge,”
she said gently, “you know a mother
who has had her little children restored to her as
I have, and largely through your good husband’s
kindness,”—here Mrs. Babbidge sent a proud
glance over at him, at which he blushed like a
girl under his big farmer’s hat he forgot to take
off,—“finds it hard to express her thanks; and
so I brought you, from my husband and from me,
a little gift.” Here Polly laid down a small parcel
on the patched bedquilt, and tucked it under
one of the drawn and twisted hands.</p>

<p>“How about the Scrannage ladies?” asked old
Mr. King, drawing Abiel off to a corner; “they’re
pretty well off, I expect.”</p>

<p>“They hain’t got much but pride,” said Abiel,
shifting from one foot to another, “but enough
o’ that to carry this hull town.”</p>

<p>“Poor, are they?” asked the old gentleman.</p>

<p>“Poor—well I should say so; why, I guess
it comes hard on ’em to keep a cat. But then
they’d rather starve themselves than to scrimp
her. But they’re monstrous ginteel.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” said the old gentleman, with
great concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“Ye see, they’re a-workin’ to pay off that there
mortgage the old squire left; been a-workin’ on’t
for twenty year now, an’ mos’ likely they’ll die
a-workin’ on’t; but then ‘we <i>will</i> die a-workin’
on’t,’ as Miss Sally said to me only t’other day;
and bless my buttons, so she will,” declared Mr.
Babbidge, slapping his knee.</p>

<p>“How much is it?” asked old Mr. King.</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars,” said Abiel.</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars!” repeated the old gentleman.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’tis, every bit; awful, ain’t it; ’cause
they’re wimmen, an’ there ain’t no way for ’em
to arn money, only to make jell.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t accept a little gift, you think?”
asked the old gentleman suddenly, “not if she was
to give it,” pointing to Polly, “or her sister?”</p>

<p>“Massy sakes—no,” cried Abiel in alarm;
“they’d set the dorg on you; that is, Miss Sally
would, if she had a dorg. They wouldn’t take it
from the angel Gabrel.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when they went out of the Babbidge
household, the old gentleman had made up
his mind to something; and, by the time they
were on the way homeward, he announced to the
rest of the procession, “We are going down to the
Scrannage house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241-242]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p241">

<p class="caption">“There now, it’s done, Grandpapa, dear,” said Phronsie, tucking
the bit of paper under the old door.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>And down to the “Scrannage house” they went.
There it stood, by the lilac-bushes, with its flag
walk between the rows of ancient box; its blue-green
blinds, and its big-knockered door—just as
it had stood in the old squire’s time, with a mortgage
on it.</p>

<p>The whole procession drew up silently. “You
all sit still,” commanded the old gentleman.
“Phronsie, you come with me.” So, Ben hopping
into the dog-cart again to hold the bay, the two
passed up between the rows of box, and halted
at the blue-green door.</p>

<p>“Now, Phronsie, I want you to help me,” said
Grandpapa, “because that Miss Sally Scrannage is
truly awful to deal with. But whether she likes
it or not, child, I’m going to lift that mortgage.”</p>

<p>“O Grandpapa, I’m so glad!” exclaimed Phronsie,
the sunlight all in her eyes.</p>

<p>“So,” said the old gentleman, “get behind the
lilac-bush here, child;” and he took out a paper
from his pocket-book that proved to be a check,
filled it out, and handed it to Phronsie. “Now
stick it under the door, Phronsie; the crack’s big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
enough. And when they get home, and find it,
and that Miss Sally comes for me, I can tell her
you did it.”</p>

<p>“I will do it, Grandpapa,” said Phronsie, running
off happily, to tuck the bit of paper under
the old door. “There, now, it’s done, Grandpapa
dear. And I am so glad.”</p>

<p>“And now let us get in, and drive off like hot
shot,” exclaimed the old gentleman, hurrying
down the path. “I really feel as if I heard
Miss Sally after us now.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br>

<small>MR. MARLOWE HELPS MATTERS ALONG.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PHRONSIE passed slowly up the path to the
little brown house door. The last of the
party of guests at “The Oaks” had just departed.
She turned the key in the lock and went in, picking
up, on her way, the playthings the children
had left the afternoon before, strewn on the old
kitchen floor.</p>

<p>Phronsie sat down on a low seat, and leaned
her head in Mamsie’s old rocking-chair. Outside,
a little gray squirrel ran up and down the big
apple-tree, and peered in the window chattering
loudly; the china basket of sweetbrier noiselessly
dropped a petal now and then on the old kitchen
table, and the clock ticked away busily; and still
Phronsie did not move.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” she was saying softly to herself,
“is it very wicked for me to <i>want</i> to see Roslyn?
I will stay with Grandpapa; but oh, I want so to
just see Roslyn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>And after a long pause she said, “I could not
ask Grace all she knows about him—oh, to think
that he is her cousin! because that would not be
right to Grandpapa, who did not want me to see
him. But oh! I cannot help thinking of him;
and is it very wicked, Mamsie, just to think
of him?”</p>

<p>Still Phronsie did not move. When she did
lift her head, there were no traces of tears upon
her cheek, only her hands were clasped upon her
knee, and a white line settled around the drooping
mouth.</p>

<p>“Dear Grandpapa,” she said softly, “he has
done everything for us, and all his comfort is in
us. He needs me; and I’ll try again not to think
of Roslyn. But oh, Mamsie!” She laid her head
once more upon the old cushion in the rocking-chair,
and kept it there for a long time.</p>

<p>Old Mr. King had gone to town in the early
morning train with Jasper. Having not only a
great delight in Mr. Marlowe, so that he seized
every possible opportunity to be with him, Mr.
King had absorbed such a violent pride in the
whole publishing business as conducted by Marlowe
and King, that he had become a silent partner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and contributed such a generous amount of
funds as to make possible the great breadth and
extension that had been longed for by its founder.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="illus_p247">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p247.jpg" alt="Phronsie leaned her head upon Mamsie’s old rocking-chair">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Phronsie leaned her head upon Mamsie’s old rocking-chair.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“And I don’t want anything to say about the
working of the capital,” the old gentleman had
cried. “Gracious, man alive,” to Mr. Marlowe,
“I don’t know anything about business; and I can
trust you, who have brought it up to this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>So Mr. King resolutely kept away from all
business conferences to which he was always
asked; and he pinched his lips under his white
mustache very tightly together whenever the fit
seized him to give advice. Whenever this was
particularly strong upon him, he invariably kept
away from town, working it off by scolding at the
editorials in the morning paper. At other times
he would sometimes take an early morning train
with Jasper, and spend hours in wandering over
the big establishment, in which he was a great
favorite, and in reading and examining the books
and periodicals turned out; swelling with pride
more and more at the splendid character of the
work he saw before him.</p>

<p>Sometimes Phronsie was with him, and often
Polly came; and now and then Elyot or King
hung to his hand, and listened to his delighted
praise of the whole thing.</p>

<p>But this day he announced that he was going
alone with Jasper. And when they arrived at
the publishing house, he said, in a very different
tone from that he had used on his first visit,—“And
what a first-class fool I was then, to be
sure,” he reflected,—“Jasper, my boy, see if Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Marlowe would like to talk with me now. If not,
I’ll go up into the bindery and see that new machine.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marlowe wasn’t ready to see him, being, as
on the former occasion, occupied with a gentleman
who had made the appointment for that hour; so
Mr. King did go up into the bindery, whereat all
the working-people looked up with a smile, as the
old gentleman made them his courtliest bow.</p>

<p>“Father,” cried Jasper, springing up the stairs
two at a time, “Mr. Marlowe is ready now. He
is dreadfully sorry to keep you waiting so long,
but it couldn’t be helped. Mr. Strong did not get
through, but lapped over on the agent of the new
paper company, who had an appointment.”</p>

<p>“Say no more, my boy,” cried his father. “I
don’t mind waiting a half-hour. I’ve nothing
special to do, and it’s pleasant up here.”</p>

<p>“A half-hour?” repeated Jasper, taking out
his watch. “You’ve been up here just three
hours, father!”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” cried the old gentleman, glancing
at it, and then whipping out his own, when he
burst out laughing, and took Jasper’s arm, and
went down-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“I move that we all three go out to luncheon,”
said Mr. Marlowe, as they came into his small
private office. “What do you say, Mr. King?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, to be sure; a good plan,” assented
the old gentleman, who always said “yes” nowadays
to everything Mr. Marlowe proposed.</p>

<p>“And we can begin our talk there, and finish
it here,” said the publisher, putting down his
desk-cover.</p>

<p>“Now, Jasper, my boy,” said old Mr. King,
when the three were together in a quiet corner
at the restaurant, “I’m going to say something
that will perhaps make you feel badly a bit.”</p>

<p>Jasper put up his hand involuntarily.</p>

<p>“It won’t make a thing come a minute the
sooner for talking of it,” said the old gentleman
cheerily; “but I’m not going to live forever, and
that’s a fact. I never should have lasted half so
long if it hadn’t been for you, my boy,” laying
his hand across the little table on Jasper’s, who
grasped it eagerly, “and for those blessed Peppers.
And, dear me, I mean to go right straight
on living a long while yet,” he added, with a
glance at Jasper’s pale face. “But I want a good
talk with both of you to-day. I don’t mind saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
that a certain thing troubles me, and I want
to get it off my mind.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marlowe said nothing, his clear-cut face
quietly turned to the old gentleman, waiting for
him to proceed.</p>

<p>“There’s no man living, Marlowe, that I’d ask
advice from sooner than you,” said Mr. King;
“and that you know.”</p>

<p>A bright smile shot over the publisher’s face,
lighting up the keen gray eyes with a world of
affection. “I know,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“It’s about Phronsie,” said old Mr. King brokenly,
and his handsome white head drooped.</p>

<p>“Don’t, father,” began Jasper, dreadfully distressed;
“Phronsie wouldn’t want you to feel
badly.”</p>

<p>“I would let your father speak what is on his
mind, Jasper,” said Mr. Marlowe quietly.</p>

<p>“She—she—oh, you know it already,” said
the old gentleman with difficulty, “formed an attachment
with a young sculptor when we were
last abroad. I introduced them myself. He’s
General May’s nephew, working in Rome; got a
high degree of talent, and all that. But, oh,
Phronsie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>Mr. Marlowe’s imperturbable countenance gave
no hint to any onlooker that anything but the
most ordinary conversation was in progress; the
other two sitting with their faces to the wall.</p>

<p>“And now that precious child is really and absolutely
in love with that man,” said Mr. King
in a subdued but dreadful voice. “I didn’t believe
it until I saw her face the other night when
little Grace said he was her cousin. Marlowe,
what <i>can</i> I do?” He grasped the strong right
hand lying on the table.</p>

<p>“Mr. King,” said the publisher, with a lightning-like
gleam in the gray eyes, “I can only tell
you certain ways of looking at the matter that
seem right to me. You may not like what I say.”</p>

<p>“You will say it all the same,” said the old
gentleman grimly.</p>

<p>“I shall say it all the same,” said Mr. Marlowe.</p>

<p>“That’s what I like you for,” broke in Mr.
King. “Why, if I hadn’t wanted the truth, I
wouldn’t have come to you, man.” He leaned forward,
and gazed into the clear gray eyes.</p>

<p>“You approve of Roslyn May as a man?” asked
Mr. Marlowe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“Dear me, yes. Why, if I hadn’t, do you suppose
I would have introduced him to Phronsie,”
cried the old gentleman, somewhat irately.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Now, what is there that you
disapprove of in him?” asked the publisher.</p>

<p>“Nothing; that is, the young fellow is all right,
I suppose, only—why Phronsie is a mere child
yet. She’s my little one!”</p>

<p>“Miss Phronsie is twenty years old,” said Mr.
Marlowe.</p>

<p>“Bless me, why so she is!” exclaimed Mr. King.
And then, as if a wholly new idea had struck him,
he kept repeating to himself at intervals as the
waiter brought the luncheon, “Phronsie is twenty
years old. Phronsie is twenty years old!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem a day since that child sent me
her gingerbread boy,” he said aloud, when the
meal was half over.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. That’s a way time has of
treating us all,” said Mr. Marlowe. “Well, I am
glad you broached this subject, Mr. King; and
now, with your permission, we will finish it when
we get back to my office.”</p>

<p>Jasper shot him a grateful glance; and quite
easy in his mind about his father, now that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
ice was really broken, and the dreaded subject
open for future discussion, he gave a sigh of relief
as he saw the countenance of the old gentleman
lighten.</p>

<p>“I take it, Mr. King,” observed Mr. Marlowe,
when they were once more in the little private
office with orders for no callers to be admitted,
“that Phronsie’s welfare is what you are most
concerned about?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried the old gentleman; “it is,
Marlowe.”</p>

<p>“Then, that is really the only thing for us to
consider in this conversation. You admit that
you believe Phronsie to be deeply in love with
this young sculptor?”</p>

<p>Old Mr. King whirled abruptly around on Jasper,
“What say you, Jasper?” he cried. “Perhaps
she isn’t,” with a sudden hope that Jasper
might confirm this. But Jasper looked him steadily
in the eyes. “You are right, father. Phronsie
has loved him ever since you brought her home, I
believe.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman groaned aloud, and caught at
the table for support.</p>

<p>“And it is only her love for you,” said Jasper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
seeing in Mr. Marlowe’s eyes the counsel that the
whole of the truth had better be spoken, “that
has made her able not to show it.”</p>

<p>Old Mr. King got out of his chair, and took as
many turns around the small room as its space
would allow, fuming like a caged animal.</p>

<p>“And what do you want me to do about it,
Marlowe?” he demanded presently, stopping
short in front of that gentleman’s office-chair.</p>

<p>“I do not want, nor advise anything,” said Mr.
Marlowe calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think I ought to do,” he
fumed—“that’s the same thing. Come, speak out
and be done with it, man.”</p>

<p>For answer, Mr. Marlowe turned to his desk
full of papers. “I’ve talked enough,” he said
with his bright smile. “Think it out for yourself,
King; you’ll do the right thing.” And he put
out his strong hand kindly. The old gentleman
grasped it without a word, and hung to it a moment,
then clapped on his hat. “I won’t wait
for you, Jasper,” he said. “I’m going home.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to go with you, father?”
cried Jasper with a glance at Mr. Marlowe.</p>

<p>“You can go just as well as not,” said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
gentleman; “there is nothing pressing this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the old gentleman imperiously;
“I’ll go by myself. Good-day, Marlowe.”</p>

<p>“Jasper,” said his friend, as the tall, stately
figure passed rapidly out down the long salesroom,
“don’t be troubled,” glancing into Jasper’s overcast
face; “it is better as it is. Let him think it
out by himself. And believe me, my boy, the
greatest kindness one can do your father, is to prevent
him from being untrue to himself.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Jasper; “but, O Mr. Marlowe!
you do know, because you’ve seen it, how he
just worships Phronsie. We all do for that matter;
but father—well, that’s different. She’s just
everything to him.”</p>

<p>“And that’s just the very reason he wants to
show her that he is worthy of it,” said the publisher
gravely; “and no one must point it out to
him. He must travel that way alone, till he can
think only of her good. And he’ll do it.”</p>

<small>ALEXIA HAS GRACE TO HERSELF.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WELL, if I’m not glad to get you here!”
cried Alexia that same morning, dragging
Grace into the front doorway of “The Pumpkin.”
“Now you shall make me such a visit!
Dear me, won’t we have good times together,”
making all sorts of wild plans in her mind on the
spot, to atone for any former coldness.</p>

<p>“I can’t stay but two days,” cried Grace in
alarm. “I’m to go back to ‘The Oaks’ then.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Why, it would take you two days
to see that blessed child alone. You’ve no idea
how he’s grown this last week,” said Alexia.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t I better see him now?” asked Grace,
feeling it unsafe to put off such a wonderful sight
any longer.</p>

<p>“That you had!” exclaimed Alexia, delighted
at such enthusiasm. “Come right up into the
nursery this very minute, Grace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>So the two ran up the winding stairs into the
tiny box of a room called the nursery. There on
the floor, sprawling after a red rubber ball, was
Algernon. His mother seized him, and covered
his round red face with kisses. “The blessed,
precious baby!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Ar-goo-goo-goo!” screamed Algernon in a passion,
and kicking fearfully.</p>

<p>“See how he tries to talk—how he <i>does</i> talk!”
cried Alexia, whirling around with him till his
arms and legs appeared to Grace like so many
spokes to a wheel in rapid motion. “Oh, my
dear! So he should tell his old mother all about
it. Grace, isn’t he perfectly wonderful?”</p>

<p>“He <i>is</i> a baby,” said Grace, saying the first
thing that came into her mind.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d say so when you came to see
him,” declared Alexia, with a triumphant flush on
her sallow face. “That isn’t half he can do, either.”</p>

<p>She set Algernon on the floor, and dropped
there herself, regardless of her elaborate morning-dress.
“Crawl over mummy, now,” she commanded.</p>

<p>But Algernon preferred to crawl just the other
way, after his ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“That’s just it!” cried Alexia delightedly.
“Now, you see he’s not to be led. He’s going
to think for himself. Oh, I expect great things
from that boy, Grace!”</p>

<p>A placid-looking woman in a big stiff white
cap sat by the window sewing.</p>

<p>“Now, there’s Bonny,” said Alexia, still sitting
on the floor, and looking over at her, “she’s thoroughly
commonplace, and can’t rise to the superiority
of that blessed child. And strange to say,
Grace, his father can’t either. But I can; oh,
you dear!” with that she caught Algernon by one
of his fat little legs, and drew him to her. And
then ensued a wild screaming on Algernon’s part,
and a petting on Alexia’s, Grace backing off to the
door, feeling that the room was too small for so
much action.</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to have a talk with you,
Grace,” said Alexia presently, and hanging tightly
to her baby, “come,” in one of the lulls when
Algernon paused to take breath, “let’s go into
your room.”</p>

<p>“Can we talk with the baby?” asked Grace
with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“Nonsense; yes, indeed! Algernon loves to hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
conversation, and he really understands a good
deal,” said Alexia, tucking her “blessed child”
under one arm, and going off. “This is your
room, right next, so you can hear his dear little
voice the first thing in the morning. Oh, you darling!”
stopping to kiss Algernon. Then she ran
with him into Grace’s small apartment room, and
dumped him into the middle of the bed. “Now,
then, Grace, he’s all right. Come in, dear, this is
your room.”</p>

<p>“Will he stay there?” asked Grace fearfully.</p>

<p>“Dear me, yes,” said Alexia; “he’s so very sensible.
And I’m going to sit this side to make it
absolutely sure. Well, now, Grace, take off your
bonnet, and come here. I want to ask you something.”</p>

<p>Grace took off her bonnet, and came round by
the side of the bed.</p>

<p>“Sit on the foot there, will you,” said Alexia.</p>

<p>“That’s a dear. Well, now, Grace, do tell me
about Roslyn May. I’ve been dying to know,
and couldn’t get a chance with all this swarm
of company around our ears, ever since you said
he was your cousin the other night. How did
that ever happen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“Why, he was born so,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Of course, you stupid child,” cried Alexia;
“why, even Algernon would know that! But I
mean—oh, isn’t it just the most wonderful thing
in all the world that it turns out that Roslyn May
is your cousin?”</p>

<p>“Why, no; I don’t see how it is very wonderful,”
said Grace in a perplexed way.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! well, you are stupid—I mean!
well, I wish I could tell you, but I suppose I
mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“And what made everybody look so queer when
I spoke his name, when Mrs. King said that the
Fishers were going to Rome?” asked Grace,
recognizing here a mystery, and meaning to get
at the bottom of it. “Why did they, Mrs.
Dodge?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! Algernon, would you tell her?”
asked his mother.</p>

<p>“Ar-goo!” said Algernon, having recovered
himself, and finding it very pleasant to pull at
the pillow-shams.</p>

<p>“There, since that blessed child says so, I believe
I ought to tell you, Grace!” said Alexia;
“and besides, all our set, the old friends I mean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
know it. Why, Phronsie Pepper and Roslyn May
are lovers.”</p>

<p>Grace gave a squeal that entirely threw Algernon’s
into the shade, as she hopped off from the
bed, and ran around into Alexia’s arms. “Oh,
say that again—do say it again, dear Mrs.
Dodge!” she cried with blazing cheeks.</p>

<p class="caption">“Ar-goo!” said Algernon, finding it very pleasant to pull at the pillow-shams.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Oh, my goodness me!” cried Alexia, feeling
of her throat; “how you scared me, Grace! And
you’ve frightened this blessed child;” as Algernon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
put up his little lip, and scuttled over like a rabbit
to the side of the bed next to his mother.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it—I can’t help it,” cried Grace
wildly, and spinning around the room on her toes;
“to think that my dear Miss Phronsie Pepper
loves my cousin Roslyn May—oh, oh!”</p>

<p>“Do stop!” cried Alexia, picking off her boy
from the bed to go after her and pluck her by the
sleeve. “Hush, hush—Bonny will hear. And
besides, it can’t ever be—no, never in all this
world, I tell you; so what’s the use of hopping
so.”</p>

<p>“Can’t ever be?” asked Grace, coming to such
a dead stop that she nearly overturned Alexia,
baby and all. “Didn’t you say, Mrs. Dodge, that
they loved each other?”</p>

<p>“Yes; oh, dreadfully!” said Alexia, backing up
against the wall; “but it won’t ever be that they
will be married, because Grandpapa King don’t
want Phronsie to be married.”</p>

<p>“He don’t want Miss Phronsie to be married
when she loves somebody?” gasped Grace.</p>

<p>“Oh, well! he doesn’t exactly believe that she
does love him,” said Alexia testily, who had privately
berated him so many times when talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
it all over with Pickering that she was now sore
on the subject, “and he wants her to himself.”</p>

<p>Grace Tupper sat down on the first thing that
she could see, which proved to be the scrap-basket.
“Doesn’t old Mr. King love Miss Phronsie?”
she gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” gasped Alexia, running to pull
at her; “but get out of that scrap-basket. Polly
Pepper made that for me years ago, and you are
mussing all the ribbons.” And calling to Bonny,
who came without a ripple on her placid countenance,
she bundled the baby into her arms, and
began to pull out the big pink bows from which
Grace gave a bound.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about it, and then you must
tell <i>me</i> all about it,” she said, when the pink
bows were found not to be much crushed after all.
“There, come over here to the sofa. It’s a mercy
that you didn’t ruin that basket. If you had, I’d
never have forgiven you, Grace Tupper, in all
this world. Well, you see, it all happened three
years ago when they were abroad,—Phronsie and
Grandpapa King and David, and the Fishers and
Charlotte Chatterton,—there was a perfect mob
of them; Charlotte was just going over to begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
to study in Germany. And although Polly
and Jasper heard something of it in Mother
Fisher’s letters, it wasn’t till they all got home
that we knew how it was. And then Roslyn
May came over twice to see her. And then the
most awful thing, Grace Tupper, in all this world,
you can’t think,” she leaned her elbows on her
knees and regarded Grace fixedly, “happened,
and I’ve been worried to death about it ever
since.”</p>

<p>“What?” Grace scarcely breathed it, while
her large blue eyes dilated fearfully.</p>

<p>“Why, Roslyn May came across just a few
weeks ago,” said Alexia in a stage whisper,
“actually came to this side of the Atlantic, and
didn’t come to see Phronsie! And I think—I
really and truly do, Grace Tupper—that Grandpapa
King had something to do about it; for
Roslyn May didn’t stay but one day. What do
you think of that?”</p>

<p>It was so very dreadful, that Grace couldn’t
think of anything for the space of a minute;
then she said, in a puzzled way, “But how could
old Mr. King have done anything when he didn’t
see Roslyn—I don’t see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“I don’t see either,” said Alexia irritably,
“but it’s my private opinion publicly confessed
that Grandpapa King is mixed up in it some
way. It worries me to skin and bone. And
Pickering won’t do anything when I beg him to,
and everything is just as horrid as it can be.
Well, now, tell me all about your cousin Roslyn
May,” she added, brightening up, and eager for
the news.</p>

<p>“Why, you see he is my very own cousin,”
cried Grace in the greatest pride.</p>

<p>“How?” interrupted Alexia; “is General May
your uncle?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Grace; “he is my mother’s brother.
And Cousin Roslyn is awfully smart. Why, when
he was a little boy he got hold of some clay,
and he made dogs and pigs and horses just as
natural. And Uncle May took him abroad—you
know his mother died when he was a baby.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Alexia.</p>

<p>“Yes, she did,” said Grace. “Well, and
Uncle May took him abroad to see if it was
really in him to be a sculptor, he said, and
everybody was perfectly astonished. But Roslyn
was determined to come home to be educated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Good for him!” cried Alexia.</p>

<p>“Yes; and so he waited till after he’d got
through college before he really did much sculpturing.
Then he went abroad to stay; and I tell
you he’s just worked! Why, haven’t you heard
of the things he has done?”</p>

<p>She opened her blue eyes widely at Alexia now.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, child, of course,” said Alexia; “I
don’t want you to tell me that newspaper talk,
I want to hear about <i>him</i>. Is he nice?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s splendid!” cried Grace, beating her
hands together. “If he were to come into the
room now, you’d say you never saw such a handsome
man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Alexia, who
had ideas of her own as to manly beauty.
“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“And all the girls are in love with him,”
said Grace; “but he’s just devoted to his art,
and he don’t care anything for any of them.”</p>

<p>“Except Phronsie,” said Alexia.</p>

<p>“Except Miss Phronsie,” cried Grace, hugging
herself at the thought. “Well, and the first bit
of money he ever earned,—it was for a fountain
or something, and it took the prize,—the design,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
I mean,—he gave it to a poor boy he knew at
home, who hadn’t any money to study with.
And mamma is going over next fall to see him;
and I’ve been teasing her to take me, but she
said I must stay with Aunt Atherton another
year and go to school. And now—O Mrs.
Dodge! I didn’t tell you, for this other news
scared it all out of my head—Mrs. King has
asked me to stay at ‘The Oaks.’”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it, Grace?” cried Alexia,
catching her by the arm; “why, I meant to
have you myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m to be with dear Mrs. King, and go
in every day to Miss Willoughby,” said Grace
in great satisfaction; “for mamma answered Mrs.
King’s letter and said so, and Miss Willoughby
says she wants me back again. She really did,
Mrs. Dodge.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it, child,” said Alexia. “I
rather like you myself. Well, now, Grace, this
troubles me.” She nursed her knee with her
long arms, and gazed into Grace’s face. “Roslyn
May is your cousin, and I am just determined
to do something to help Phronsie. I can’t keep
still any longer; I shall fly out of my head if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
do. Now, can’t you write to him, and ask him
why he didn’t come to see Phronsie when he
was over last time? That will bring some sort of
an answer, and at least tell us the reason.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so I will!” cried Grace, springing up; “I
will write it now, this very minute.” Then she
stopped suddenly, and her face turned scarlet.
“Mrs. Dodge,” she said, “I’d rather not. I’ve
just been silly, you know, and—and—I don’t
mean to do anything I don’t ask Miss Phronsie
or Mrs. King about first.”</p>

<p>“And you blessed child,” cried Alexia, kissing
her, “I knew the minute I’d asked you I’d said
the wrong thing. To tell you the truth, Grace,
I never do a single thing without asking Pickering
first. Oh, dear me! but what <i>shall</i> we do? Things
can’t be left to themselves so. Something must
be done.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>

<small>GRANDPAPA DOES THE RIGHT THING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE little brown house door opened slowly,
and some one came in. Phronsie raised
her head. “Why, Grandpapa!” she exclaimed,
“have you come home?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I thought I would, Phronsie; there
wasn’t much to detain me, and I finished early.”</p>

<p>Phronsie had risen and hurried over to him,
putting her hand affectionately through his arm.
“You are not sick, Grandpapa dear?” she asked,
anxiously looking up into his face.</p>

<p>“No, no, child; that is, only sick of myself,”
he answered with a short laugh. Phronsie stood
quite still in a puzzled way, regarding him closely.
“There’s nothing to worry about, Phronsie, nothing
at all. Only I thought I’d have a little talk
with you. Come here, child.” He took a seat
in a big easy-chair, and drew her to his knee.
“There, now we can be comfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>Phronsie fixed her brown eyes upon him wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Phronsie, I’ve always been a curious old chap.
I wouldn’t say so to any one else, only to you,
dear; but I have.”</p>

<p>“O Grandpapa!” cried Phronsie convulsively,
and throwing her arms around his neck, “don’t,
don’t, dear Grandpapa! You’ve always and ever
been beautiful,” she sobbed in great distress.</p>

<p>“Well, there, there, child,” said the old gentleman,
patting her back as if she were three years
old, and mightily pleased with her tribute, “you
love the old man, and that’s enough. But what
I should have done without you, child, no living
mortal knows. I’m sure I cannot tell. Well;
and now, Phronsie, I want to say something, and
you must hear me. Sit up, dear, and let me see
your eyes.”</p>

<p>So Phronsie sat up quite straight on his knee,
and he held her hands, and she never took her
eyes from his face, but listened attentively to
every word.</p>

<p>“You see, Phronsie, it’s just this way. I’ve been
thinking over many things lately, and I’ve come
to the conclusion that I made a mistake in sending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Roslyn May off. So I’ve just been writing
to him that it strikes me he would better run
across again.”</p>

<p>All the pink color had gone from Phronsie’s
cheek long ago, and she now sat pale and still,
her brown eyes fastened on his face.</p>

<p>“Does that please you, child?” asked old Mr.
King after a pause, and smoothing her yellow
hair.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa, has some one been speaking to
you about it, and wanting you to write to Roslyn?”
she asked suddenly; the brown eyes
flashed, and she looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>“No indeed; I thought it all out by myself,”
he answered with conscious pride, “and it seems
to me the best thing to be done. Really it does,
Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Do <i>you</i> wish it, Grandpapa?” she asked
slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, child. Listen, now, Phronsie.
You are not to cry, child, nor to feel badly; but
you know Grandpapa is an old man, and cannot
last forever, and”—</p>

<p>For answer, Phronsie dropped her head upon
his breast, and cried bitterly. It was some time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
before he could soothe her, though he tried every
means in his power. At last he said, “This is
making me ill, child.”</p>

<p>Phronsie took up her head quickly, and put her
hand caressingly over his white hair. “Does it,
Grandpapa?” she asked, her face working convulsively.</p>

<p>“Yes; that is, I shall be,” said the old gentleman
artfully, “if you cry. And if you want to
please me, Phronsie, you will be very glad that
I wrote to Roslyn. I want to see you happily
settled myself, child, and to enjoy it all. Why, I
expect to live years and years, Phronsie;” and
he sat erect, and looked so handsome and strong,
that Phronsie smiled through her tears. “Don’t
you love him, child?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandpapa,” said Phronsie, “I do.”</p>

<p>“Very much?” asked old Mr. King, with a
dreadful pang at his heart.</p>

<p>“Very much indeed,” said Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Child, child, why didn’t you tell me?” he
cried, holding her to him remorsefully. “Oh,
why didn’t you tell your old Grandpapa?” he
groaned.</p>

<p>It was now Phronsie’s turn to comfort him; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
he felt so very badly, that it was some time before
she could get him out of the dreadful state into
which he was plunged. But at last they emerged
from the little brown house hand in hand, Phronsie
looking up into his smiling face.</p>

<p>“I’ve been hunting just everywhere for you,
father dear,” cried Polly, running down the terrace
to meet them, and waving a yellow envelope.
“It’s from Mamsie, of course. Do open it,
Grandpapa,” lapsing, as she often did, into the
old familiar title, “and see what she says.”</p>

<p>With a merry laugh, and holding it so that
Phronsie could see, the old gentleman tore it
open, and stared blankly at the words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hotel Constanzi, Rome</span>, <i>June 22, 18—</i>.</p>

<p>“Roslyn May very ill with low fever. Come and bring
Phronsie.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Adoniram Fisher.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>They were off the next morning, Grandpapa
and Phronsie, hurrying down to New York to sail
on the following day. Joel, informed of it by
telegram, got a brother minister to take his place
for a fortnight or so, and determined to go too.
And hardly before Polly and the rest of the home
people at “The Oaks” had accustomed themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
to think of it as a settled thing surely to
be, the little party were off on the waste of
waters, that lengthened every day into a terrible
distance between them and their dear home. But
they were going to Mamsie and to Roslyn! And
although Mr. King was dreadfully overcome at
the thought of what might meet them at the end
of the journey, as a result (he now felt quite
sure) of his meddling with Phronsie’s happiness,
he kept up pluckily on her account, and never let
a sign of his inward trepidation be seen.</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do”—Joel was saying very
carelessly, as Phronsie came up to him on deck,
to a very elegant-looking person, who extended
two fingers to her—“Mr. Bayley, Mr. Livingston
Bayley, you remember, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Livingston Bayley,” said that gentleman,
as the young girl bowed, presenting a handsome,
showily dressed person, who eyed Phronsie
all over. “Well, ’pon me honor, this is not half
bad, don’t you know, to meet in this way.”</p>

<p>Phronsie, not knowing exactly what to reply,
left it to Joel, who didn’t care to, but stood
gazing blankly out to sea.</p>

<p>“We have only been in America a week,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
the lady in a sweet little drawl, “and I made
Mr. Bayley bring me directly to London again.
I absolutely could not exist unless he did.”</p>

<p>“A beastly boat, ain’t it now?” said Mr. Bayley
with a yawn.</p>

<p>“Haven’t tried it yet enough to say,” replied
Joel with a short laugh.</p>

<p>“How are all your family?” asked Mr. Bayley
a trifle awkwardly, which so disconcerted him that
he paused mid-air for another idea.</p>

<p>“All very well, thank you,” said Joel.</p>

<p>“Your sister, Mrs. King, is she well now?”
pursued Mr. Bayley, trying to be very nonchalant,
and fumbling at his cigarette case.</p>

<p>“Very well indeed, thank you,” said Joel.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bayley, I think I must have my constitutional
now,” said his wife with another drawl, and
putting her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, certainly—certainly,” said Mr. Bayley.
“Well, I’m awfully glad, don’t you know,
that we’ve met again,” making elaborate adieux.</p>

<p>“And I hope we shall see much of each other
on the voyage,” said Mrs. Bayley sweetly, with no
eyes for any one but Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Joel as they swept off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“If you please, miss,” said the deck-steward,
coming up and touching his cap respectfully to
Phronsie, “there’s an old woman who says she
wishes you would come to see her. She’s in her
stateroom.”</p>

<p>“An old woman?” asked Phronsie wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss. She didn’t give her name, but said
she saw you come on board yesterday. And she’s
very urgent, miss.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you to the door, and you can find
out who she is,” said Joel.</p>

<p>Phronsie moved off after the steward, and held
out her hand to Joel. “You can wait for me outside.”</p>

<p>The stateroom, small and uncomfortable, into
which she was ushered, while Joel paced up and
down outside, was so dark, that at first Phronsie
could not see distinctly its occupant.</p>

<p>“O miss!” cried an old lady, trying to rise in
her berth, and brushing away the straying white
hair from her cheek, “you don’t remember me.
But I’ll never forget you nor your face.” It was
Phronsie’s little old woman of the Berton electric
car.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” asked Phronsie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
gently, and standing by the berth she smoothed
the straying hair.</p>

<p>“O miss, I’m afraid I’m going to die, and I
can’t when I’m just going home.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will die,” said Phronsie,
“and I am sorry you feel ill.”</p>

<p>“It is just this way, miss. I’m all worn out
with gladness to get home and put my feet on
English ground,” said the little old woman hungrily.
“But I must tell you about it; because if
I should die, I want you to know all about it.
You see, my husband and I came over because
he didn’t want to live on his sons, and he fancied
America, and being independent there in a new
country. And so we came a good many years
ago; and our sons felt dreadfully, for they wanted
us to stay with them. But John, he’s my husband,
said ‘no,’ and you couldn’t move him.
Well, we were very happy living in a little
home of our own, and my husband worked the
ground to suit himself as best he could; and
though I worried some, and I know he did, only
he was always still like, to see the grandchildren,
they were so cunning when we came away, we did
pretty well. Only English ways of farming are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
different from yours, and John was too old to
learn new ways, and so we began to get behind.
And we didn’t care to make new friends, and we
didn’t know how, and so when John was taken
away there wasn’t any one to advise me, and the
property was sold off for almost nothing. And
after I’d got a letter, I had it in my pocket the
day you were kind to me in the car, I was all so in
a tremble I hadn’t read it, I just sat down and
answered it when I got home. It was from one
of my sons; and I told him the whole truth, and he
sent me the money, and told me to come on this
boat. But I’m trembling so, miss,” she held up
her thin arm that shook like a leaf, “that I’m
afraid I won’t last till I get there. And I want
you to see my boy, who’ll be there to meet me,
and tell him for me that his father said he was
sorry we came away, before he died, and he sent
his love to both of ’em, and he blessed all the
grandchildren, and so do I;” and her voice sank
to a whisper.</p>

<p>Phronsie knelt down by the berth, and put her
face very near to the troubled one. “Don’t be
worried,” she said, as if to a child. “You are
lonely, I think, but not very ill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“Ain’t I ill, miss?” cried the little old woman
pleadingly. “Oh, I’m so glad! I thought I was
going to be most dreadfully sick, and I was afraid
to call the doctor to hear him say so;” and she
gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“No,” said Phronsie; “I do not really think
you are very ill, but I do believe you want
something to eat. Now, I am going to tell you
what I think you had better do, if you want to
have me.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would, miss,” said the little old
woman gratefully, and clinging to her.</p>

<p>“A cup of beef tea is the first thing,” said
Phronsie cheerfully; and getting to her feet she
touched the electric button, and on the appearance
of the deck-steward, ordered it; “and then
I will brush your hair, and you shall sit up in
bed, and I will talk to you.”</p>

<p>“O miss, how good you are!” exclaimed the
little old woman, leaning back against her pillows,
while two tears coursed down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Joey, dear,” said Phronsie, going to the door
of the stateroom, “I am going to stay here now
a little while. It is all right, dear,” as Joel took
a look within. The next moment he marched in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
and up to the side of the berth, and put out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Well, my good Mrs. Benson, how did you get
here?”</p>

<p>The little old woman gave a scream of delight.
“O Mr. Pepper!” she exclaimed, seizing his hand.</p>

<p>“It’s one of my good parishioners, Phronsie,”
said Joel, taking both of the thin little hands in
his big strong one; “but I lost sight of her, and
nobody could tell me where she went.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to let you know,” said Mrs.
Benson shamefacedly; “so I was going to write
you as soon as I got to England, and my son was
going to write too, and thank you for all your
kindness to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you don’t know how I looked for
you,” said Joel, shaking his crop of short black
curls, that was a dreadful cross for him to carry,
as he admired straight hair intensely, especially
“in the ministry,” as he said.</p>

<p>“Well, I went up to Berton,” said little Mrs.
Benson, “because folks said that there I could
get a place as matron in an orphan asylum. But
I didn’t—and then came my son’s letter.”</p>

<small>TRYING TO BE CHEERY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“OH, dear, dear!” King struggled manfully
with his sobs, and then wailed outright;
and running into Polly’s room he crouched behind
the door.</p>

<p>Grace Tupper came after him. “King, you
mustn’t,” she whispered, leaning over to pull him
out.</p>

<p>“Let me be!” cried King, wriggling away from
her; and he roared on.</p>

<p>“Your sister Polly will hear you,” cried Grace
desperately.</p>

<p>“She can’t; she’s got comp’ny,” sobbed King in
a fresh burst. “I wa—want Phronsie, I do!”</p>

<p>“So we all want her,” said Grace with set
teeth; “but, O King! don’t cry, dear. There,
there, I’m sorry for you.” She smoothed his
stubby head with a kind hand, wishing she could
say something to comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“Who’ll he—hear my lessons?” blubbered
King, who never had been known to worry over
them before; “and if I don’t say ’em, Mamsie
won’t tell me I’ve been a good boy. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Now, there is something I can do,” cried Grace
joyfully, “I can hear those lessons, King; and
just as soon as Mrs. King’s company has gone,
I mean to ask her if I mayn’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you,” said King, with one eye
on her, the other obscured by his arm, and feeling
dreadfully sorry that he had mentioned lessons
anyway.</p>

<p>“But I can help Mrs. King,” cried Grace in
a transport, flying around the room; “for of
course she will have to hear them now. And, O
King! I’ll make you pictures of the countries you
study about, and the natives, and”—</p>

<p>“What’s natifs?” asked King, bringing the
other eye out.</p>

<p>“Why, the people who live there, and”—</p>

<p>“And make bears, will you, Miss Grace?”
cried King, dreadfully excited, and springing out
in front of her. “Oh, say, <i>please</i> do—and have
’em catch some of the natifs, and chew ’em, and
’most eat ’em up. Will you, Miss Grace?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Yes, I’ll make bears,” said Grace, glad now
of her power to sketch, “and ever so many other
things, King; that is, if you are good,” she said
hastily.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll be just as good as everything,” said
King, clasping his hands. “Begin now, do, Miss
Grace;” and he began to pull her along to the
little room where the lessons were always said.</p>

<p>“No, King,” said Grace, “I can’t begin those
lessons until I ask your sister Polly first. But
I’ll draw you a picture of anything you choose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” exclaimed King, jumping up and
down, and making so much noise that Elyot came
running in, and after him Barby, trailing her doll
by one leg.</p>

<p>“Stop, you mustn’t come in here!” shouted
King, with a very red face, and trying to slam
the door against them; “Miss Grace and I are
going to do something.”</p>

<p>“What you going to do?” demanded Elyot,
crowding in.</p>

<p>“What going to do?” asked Barby, wriggling
and pushing.</p>

<p>“Go right straight out!” demanded King, pushing
the door with all his might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“O King, King!” cried Grace, pulling at his
sailor collar.</p>

<p>“This is my mamma’s room,” said Elyot
stoutly; “and I am not going out—so there!”</p>

<p>“My mummy’s room,” declared Barby, shaking
her curls at him; “an’ I’m coming in, I
am.”</p>

<p>“You sha’n’t. We’re going to draw the most
beautiful pictures of bears—and eating men up,
and everything,” howled King quite beside himself,
and beginning to use his teeth and fingernails.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” cried Grace Tupper, unable
to do a thing to stop them. And she sat right
down in the middle of the floor, and began to cry.</p>

<p>Polly’s company just departing, Polly ran
lightly over the stairs. “Why—children!” she
exclaimed, pausing at the landing.</p>

<p>“He’s going to draw be-yewtiful bears,
mummy,” cried Barby, dreadfully excited; and
being the nearest to the hall, she ran out, and
threw herself into her mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“O boys—boys!” cried Polly sorrowfully, coming
in, Barby hanging to her gown.</p>

<p>Both boys, now engaged in a lively tussle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
stopped pulling each other’s hair, and sat up.
Grace Tupper sat still and cried on.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t let me come in and see it all,”
cried Elyot with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“No, he wouldn’t, mummy,” said Barby, shaking
her head.</p>

<p>“And Miss Grace was going to draw ’em for
me,” screamed King; “and they pushed and
scrouged dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“What?” said Polly. “Where did you learn
that word, King?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear!” wailed Grace. “I’m afraid
I’m to blame, dear Mrs. King; but I said I’d
draw him some bears—I wanted to help; and
now I’ve only made you trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Grace dear!” said Polly gently, “you
haven’t made any trouble. It was very nice and
kind of you to offer to do that.”</p>

<p>She had such a sorrowful look in her face
as she sat down, that the boys crept near, and
hung their heads.</p>

<p>“I—I—didn’t mean to,” said King, trying
not to whimper, “sister Polly, I really didn’t.”
And he was quite near now; but Polly didn’t
look at him nor stir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>“Please don’t look like that, mamma,” begged
Elyot, feeling cold creeps down his back, “I
never’ll do so again.”</p>

<p>“Never’ll do so again,” hummed Barby, playing
with her mother’s rings.</p>

<p>“To think that when Mamsie is away, and
she trusts us all,” said Polly, when she could
find her voice, “that we should do such dreadful
things.”</p>

<p>The boys wriggled and twisted, and hid their
faces.</p>

<p>“And then, when Phronsie has had to go off
with Grandpapa—oh, it quite breaks me down,”
said Polly, and there was a tremble in her voice.</p>

<p>At this, both boys precipitated themselves into
her lap, where they burrowed in speechless misery,
Barby yielding herself to it all with a happy
little crow as if part of the play.</p>

<p>“No, no, Barby,” said Polly gently, and shaking
her head at her; “mamma is not playing
now. We have been very naughty. Go and get
your little chairs, boys, and sit down quietly.”</p>

<p>So the two boys went out and dragged in
their two little cane-seat chairs, and planted themselves
down in them, Barby being put on a corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
of the lounge. And Polly took Grace out
into another room and heard all about it.</p>

<p>“Sister Polly!” called King presently, “oh, do
come here!” There was such a cry in his voice
that Polly hurried in, and found him sobbing as
if his heart would break. “I can’t sit here any
longer—don’t make me,” and he hid his face on
her neck. “I think of everything bad I ever
did. O sister Polly! I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p>“Then that is as long as I want you to sit
here,” said Polly, helping him out.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to sit longer,” said Elyot gloomily,
“because I’m not sorry,” as King rushed to kiss
him. “I wanted to hear about the bears too.”</p>

<p>“And I want bears too,” declared Barby from
her sofa; “bad, naughty King.”</p>

<p>“You shall have the bears,” cried King radiantly,
running up to her; “yes, you shall, Barby;
the very first picture Miss Grace draws you shall
have it—and Elyot shall have the next,” he
said, after a minute’s hard thinking.</p>

<p>Polly sent him a happy little smile that
warmed every corner of his small heart.</p>

<p>“Mayn’t Elyot get out now, sister Polly?”
he asked pleadingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“I’m not sorry,” said Elyot stoutly. “No;
I’ve got to stay.”</p>

<p>“You may go out, King, and you too, Barby,”
said Polly slowly, “and shut the door.”</p>

<p>“No; I’m going to stay,” said Barby perversely.</p>

<p>“Barbara.”</p>

<p>Barby slipped to the ground and edged out, and
King closed the door, feeling that it wasn’t so
easy to undo being naughty after all.</p>

<p>In a minute the door was opened slowly, and
King’s head appeared. “Sister Polly,” he said,
“it truly wasn’t Elyot’s fault, because if I’d let
them in, he would have been good.”</p>

<p>“Go out, dear,” said Polly gently, “and close
the door.”</p>

<p>When the door was opened again, Elyot walked
into the little room where they were all waiting
for him. No one had done anything, and
Grace’s hands were idle in her lap. Elyot
walked up to her. “I’m sorry I made you feel
badly, Miss Grace,” he said; and then he ran
and threw his arms around King. “I don’t want
the bears; I’d rather you had them,” he cried.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p290">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p290.jpg" alt="Barby hurried over to Grace">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Barby hurried over to Grace. ‘I’m sorry too,’ she said; ‘and I’ll take
the bears.’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Barby hurried over to Grace. “I’m sorry too,”
she said; “and I’ll take the bears if nobody wants
’em.” So a space being cleared in the middle of
the room, Polly had her little sewing-table brought
in; and presently there was a delightful hum, and
everybody talking and laughing at once. And it
was found that Grace Tupper could draw everything
in the most delightful fashion. And bears
pursuing men and women and children in the
most impossible places, were executed, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
sorts of hair-breadth escapes were indulged. And
then the children wanted to color the pictures
with their crayons, and then to cut them out;
until the first thing they knew, the “little publishing
bag” was swung over their heads.</p>

<p>“O papa!” screamed the two, and “O brother
Jasper!” howled King, “is it so late?” And
then they all swarmed around him to show their
work; and Grace Tupper’s face flushed rosier
yet at the praise, for Polly had come in, and was
hanging on her husband’s arm.</p>

<p>And in the midst of the noise and bustle the
children made,—for they seized their papa, and
made him play “bear-garden” in earnest,—Grace
made bold to proffer her request to Polly that
she might try to hear King’s lessons.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t know enough,” she said
humbly; “but oh! won’t you let me try, dear Mrs.
King?”</p>

<p>And Polly, looking into the blue eyes, said,
“Yes;” and Grace ran off on happy feet, resolved
to do her very best, and to put in practice all that
she had ever learned at school. How she wished
now that there were no idle hours to think of!
“But Mrs. King would say that it was of no use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
to spend time to think of that now,” she said to
herself, “but to take hold of the books at once.”</p>

<p>“What a comfort Grace is!” said Polly to Jasper,
as they were beginning to try a new duet, and
just as he was setting it in place on the music-rest,
“isn’t she, Jasper?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” he said heartily.</p>

<p>But in spite of all their efforts to be cheerful
and gay, time dragged heavily enough. And the
first few days after Grandpapa and Phronsie went,
Jasper had hard work to leave Polly when he ran
off to business in the early train.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay home with you, dear,” he said on the
third morning, as he saw the pale face, and the
sorrowful look in the usually laughing eyes, “and
we will go and drive, Polly;” cut to the heart to
see her so.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Jasper!” she said quickly, the color
flooding her face, “oh, how could I be so selfish!
I didn’t think it would worry you so, and I’ll
make myself look cheerful. Oh! it would just kill
me to have you leave your work. Indeed, Jasper,
it would.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t, Polly,” said Jasper reluctantly;
“and don’t worry about Roslyn May. I do believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
they’ll find things better than they fear,
when they get there.”</p>

<p>“But supposing they shouldn’t,” breathed Polly
fearfully.</p>

<p>“They will, I verily believe,” said Jasper in
ringing tones. “And just think, Polly, if all
goes well, and the boat makes her usual time,
they’ll be there on Monday.”</p>

<p>Polly counted the days and hours, and “even
minutes” Alexia said, and was surprised herself
to see how swiftly they flew by.</p>

<p>“It’s such a comfort to think that Joey could
go with them,” she said one day, when Alexia
ran over and up into her pretty room to bewail
her woes over a new gown the dressmaker had
sent home. Alexia had worn it over to show it
to Polly; and she now turned this way and that,
declaring each side was just so much worse than
the other.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such a fright, Polly Pepper?”
she cried, quite overcome, and sinking into
the first chair she could find—“and to think
it was to be my very best gown.”</p>

<p>“Take care,” warned Polly, “you will spoil all
that ruching.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“I don’t care,” said Alexia recklessly, with a
vicious pull at a refractory bow. “Now, look at
that; everything sticks up that should lie down,
and flops where it ought to stand out. Oh, dear
me! I just had to wear it over to show you
before Pickering sees it, and to let off steam, because
I don’t want to worry him, poor boy. It’s
quite bad enough to pay the bills. Oh, that horrible
old Miss Flint! Polly Pepper, what <i>shall</i>
I do?”</p>

<p>Polly dropped the brush with which she was
brushing out her bright brown hair, and ran over.
“I’ll tell you what, Alexia,” she said cheerily,
“I think it’s these dreadful bows that are not
put on rightly, that make half the trouble,” picking
out one of them; “and then she has the
shoulder-puffs too big.”</p>

<p>“They’re enormous!” exclaimed Alexia, rolling
her eyes to compass them both. “I look just
like a toad, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Now, if those were down in the right place,”
said Polly, taking little puckers in them, and
then standing back to view the effect, “it would
make ever so much difference in that gown; you
can’t think, Alexia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“Well, I begin to see hope for it,” said Alexia,
sitting up straight with her usual air; “but when
I came in, actually, Polly, I was all gone to
pieces, I was so blue. Oh! what were you saying
as I came in? I remember now; it was about
Joel.”</p>

<p>“I was saying it was such a comfort to think
that Joey could go with Grandpapa and Phronsie,”
said Polly, flying over to the toilet-table to
her hair again.</p>

<p>“I should think so,” cried Alexia, between
whom and Joel there had always been a great
friendship, though nothing could be farther from
their thoughts than to show it to each other.
“My goodness me! Joel Pepper is just the most
splendid man that ever lived, except Pickering
and Jasper.”</p>

<small>FIRE!</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MISS PEPPER,” Mrs. Livingston Bayley
called sweetly but insistently as Phronsie
hurried by.</p>

<p>“I cannot stop now,” said Phronsie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bayley reserved her anger, and picked up
her novel, until her husband sauntered up. Then
she turned on him furiously from her steamer-chair.</p>

<p>“Livingston,” she said, forgetting to drawl,
“it is perfectly preposterous in Phronsie Pepper
to go on so. I don’t see what Mr. King is thinking
of to allow it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t have anything to do with Phronsie
Pepper,” declared Mr. Bayley, in a very bad
temper, and sitting down, after carefully adjusting
the creases along his trousers legs, “don’t
you know; so what is the use of pitching into
a fellow, Celestine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“In all our conversation, I have observed you
are always very cross if I allude to the Peppers
in any way. It is extremely uncomfortable for
me, Livingston, to have you assume such an attitude
toward me.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p297">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p297.jpg" alt="“Now, Celestine,” said Mr. Bayley, rolling a fresh cigarette">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Now, Celestine,” said Mr. Bayley, rolling a fresh cigarette, “the Peppers
are perfectly well able to take care of themselves.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mr. Bayley said something way down in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
throat, and got out of his steamer-chair for a
turn or two on deck.</p>

<p>“Now, Celestine,” he said, coming back and rolling
a fresh cigarette as he stood over her, “I
want you to understand, once for all, that I’m
not going to be drawn into collision with the
Peppers, don’t you know. They are perfectly
well able to take care of themselves; and I
wouldn’t advise you to try it on, either.”</p>

<p>“She has no mother with her, or”—</p>

<p>“And you’ll be a mother to her. Celestine,
that’s too good, don’t you know. Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“Your mirth is always as ill-timed as your
other attempts at ideas,” remarked his wife
angrily. “I repeat, Phronsie Pepper has no
mother with her to advise her.”</p>

<p>“But she has old Mr. King; and he’s just the
very—well, if you want to tackle him, go
ahead.”</p>

<p>“I certainly shall speak to her,” said Mrs.
Bayley with dignity.</p>

<p>“And when the old man gets through with
you, perhaps you’d like to try your hand on her
brother, Joel Pepper. But I don’t believe you
will, Celestine, I give you my word for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>He tossed that cigarette overboard, it not having
been rolled to suit him, and began on another.</p>

<p>“To think of that girl, with her beauty and
advantages, taking up with a miserable old dowdy
of a woman whom nobody knows a thing about,
and spending all her time on her.”</p>

<p>“When she might be with you,” cut in Mr.
Bayley, getting into his steamer-chair again, and
leaning his elbows on his knees to assist him
through his arduous labor.</p>

<p>“When she might be with me,” repeated
Celestine calmly; “think what I could be to that
girl,” she added complacently, and playing with
her rings.</p>

<p>“She isn’t awake to those immense advantages,”
observed her husband; “that is, don’t
appear to be.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll make her, then,” declared Mrs.
Bayley, setting her teeth hard together.</p>

<p>Mr. Bayley laughed softly to himself.</p>

<p>“Hush! here she comes,” said Mrs. Bayley
under her breath. “O Miss Phronsie!” she
smiled sweetly on her.</p>

<p>“Did you want to see me?” asked Phronsie.
“I beg your pardon for not stopping.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>Mr. Bayley got out of his steamer-chair, and
pressed it upon her elaborately. “Do sit down,
Miss Phronsie,” begged his wife cordially.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Phronsie, “but I cannot,
Mrs. Bayley.”</p>

<p>“You never give me any of your time,” said
that lady, calling to her aid a reproachful look,
an expression that had always brought down other
victims, “and you know I have some claim upon
you, as my husband is an old friend of your
family.” She hadn’t meant to say this when she
began, but for some unaccountable reason her
supply of words seemed to give out.</p>

<p>As this required no answer, Phronsie did not
give any, but remained silent, standing by the
steamer-chair.</p>

<p>“You have sufficient time for <i>new</i> friends,”
said the lady with emphasis; “I have seen you
with an old woman on the deck several times
the last two days.”</p>

<p>“She needs me,” said Phronsie quietly; “she
is all alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is just it,” exclaimed Mrs. Bayley
eagerly, welcoming her chance; and throwing
back her head, she said rapidly, “do you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
I don’t think it is wise to take up with that old
thing. Nobody knows who she is, and it’s an
awful bore for you—wastes your time and all
that. Now, let me give you a piece of advice,
Miss Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Phronsie; “but my Grandpapa
is here, you know, and my brother,” she
did not finish, “to whom I can apply for advice.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bayley colored angrily. “But they are
men, and they don’t think. Now, there are some
very desirable people on board here, and Mr.
Bayley and I could put you in the way of making
some of the best of friends—the very best.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bayley made a sudden movement, and said
something to his wife of which “don’t you know”
was all that came to the surface.</p>

<p>“And at any rate,” hurried on Mrs. Bayley, as
she saw Phronsie’s face, “you might amuse me.
I am awfully <i>desolée</i>, Miss Pepper, and don’t
know what to do with myself.”</p>

<p>Phronsie instinctively glanced at Mr. Bayley.</p>

<p>“Oh, he is no good!” exclaimed his wife petulantly;
“all he thinks of is his cigarettes, and how
soon he will be ashore to get to the horse-races.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Livingston Bayley with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
bow, “much obliged, I’m sure. Miss Pepper,
don’t look shocked; it’s all right, don’t you know,
I’m quite used to it, only I didn’t think she’d ring
up the curtain for your benefit.” And as Phronsie
made her excuses and went back, he said, “Well,
that’s number one, Celestine. Wonder if you’ll
try it again, don’t you know;” and strolled off.</p>

<p>Phronsie was back, tucking up the steamer-rug
over the thin little figure in the chair marked
“Miss Pepper.” “Now,” she said gayly, “you
are all comfortable, you are sure, Mrs. Benson?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, deary, I couldn’t be more so,” said the
little old lady gratefully. “And now, don’t you
stay with me any more, but just go and enjoy
yourself. I saw you talking with some of your
fine friends just now, and you’ve left them to
come to me. And it worries me, Miss Pepper.”</p>

<p>“I do not want to go back,” said Phronsie;
“and they are no special friends of ours.”</p>

<p>Joel came up just then, and brought a steamer-chair
for Phronsie, and put her in it. He smiled
at her and at old Mrs. Benson, but Phronsie
looked up in his face quickly. “Joel,” she exclaimed
as he bent over her, “what is it? Is
Grandpapa all right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>“Yes indeed; right and sound as a nut,” he
said quickly. “He’s deep in his book, and won’t
stir for an hour you may depend.”</p>

<p>Phronsie leaned back in her chair only half-satisfied,
as Joel gave her another smile and
hurried off.</p>

<p>He didn’t appear at dinner; and Grandpapa,
who always ate his three meals a day on shipboard,
and knew that Joel did the same, thought
it odd. “Ah, Joel’s knocked over,” he said with
a laugh, “now we’ll take him down, Phronsie, for
being a poor sailor.”</p>

<p>Phronsie glanced across at his vacant place with
a sigh; but she smiled cheerily to the old gentleman,
and the meal went on, old Mr. King being
in the best of spirits, and the life of the captain’s
table.</p>

<p>At nightfall, as little Mrs. Benson slipped off
to her stateroom, Phronsie parted with her at
the door. “Now I know, deary, the Lord means
me to see my old home once more. Seems as if I
could smell the green grass;” she grasped the
young girl’s hands eagerly, and there was a world
of longing in her quiet eyes. “O Miss Pepper!
there’s no grass like the green grass of old England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
and there’s no sun like the sun that shines
over old England. I’ve been hungry for it, dear,”
her voice sank to a happy whisper; “but now I’m
almost there.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Phronsie, happy in the other’s happiness,
and feeling a little of her own dreadful
load of suspense lifted; “we shall be in port day
after to-morrow if all goes well.”</p>

<p>“Only one more day after to-morrow,” said the
little old lady with a sudden cry of joy, “and I
shall see my two boys. Praise the Lord! Well,
will you kiss me good-night, deary, and forgive an
old woman for keeping you standing so long?”</p>

<p>Phronsie bent over, and laid her fresh young
lips on the withered cheek.</p>

<p>“Good-night, deary; and the Lord give you all
you want.”</p>

<p>Phronsie went back to stay with Grandpapa on
deck. It was a beautiful night, and he wanted
nothing so much as to pace up and down proudly
with her on his arm. “It passes my mind where
Joel is,” he said after a little pause. “He’s not
in his stateroom; I went there after dinner. Sly
dog! I suppose he’s working off his seasickness
somewhere, and hopes to keep it from us. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
we’ll take the wind out of Master Joel’s sails—eh,
Phronsie;” and he chuckled at the delight in prospect
over laughing at Joel’s boast that he’d never
been seasick in his life, “and nothing can make
me seasick, sir!”</p>

<p class="caption">“Bless the Lord, Phronsie,” he lifted his sea-cap reverently, “we’re
almost there.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“And now, child, I can’t say how thankful I am
we’re nearly across. It’s been the longest voyage;
can’t help but be, when one is anxious to have it
over. But bless the Lord, Phronsie,” he lifted
his sea-cap reverently and looked out into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
beautiful night, “we’re almost there. And, my
child,” here he pressed Phronsie’s arm tenderly,
“I can’t tell you how I feel, to see you bearing
with the old man all these days, after what I’ve
caused you. Oh, I can’t, Phronsie!” His voice
broke, and Phronsie could feel the thrill that went
all over him.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” she begged, and made him look
into her face. “Why, how can you,” she cried
brightly, “when we’re almost there? And you’ve
borne up so well, Grandpapa dear.”</p>

<p>“To be sure—to be sure!” exclaimed the old
gentleman, pulling up his stately figure to its
greatest height; “well, where do you suppose
that rascal Joel is?”</p>

<p>It was a good two hours after when Grandpapa
said, “Good-night, dear,” and kissed her.
Phronsie threw on her steamer-cloak, and sat
down in her stateroom to wait for—she knew
not what. But she must see Joel some way.</p>

<p>“I cannot ring for the steward, for Grandpapa
will then hear me in the next room. O Joey,
Joey! But I know he’s not sick,” went on
Phronsie to herself—“by the way, he looked as
if he didn’t want me to question him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>Suddenly there came a little knock, and in an
instant Joel was in the stateroom. Phronsie
started to her feet, and took his hands.</p>

<p>“O Joey!” she cried, trying not to scream; for
his face was black with grime, and drawn and
haggard. “There, there, don’t try to tell me
what has happened,” as he laid his head on her
arm.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve tried my best—we all have,” said
Joel with a convulsive effort, and raising his
head, his face working dreadfully; “but it’s
gained on us—the ship’s on fire, Phronsie!
Hush! we can keep it from Grandpapa a little
longer, maybe till morning. O Phronsie!” He
held her so closely that she could scarcely breathe.
“It broke out in the cotton waste this morning—must
have been smouldering some time.”</p>

<p>“You have been helping?” asked Phronsie,
as he paused unable to utter another word.</p>

<p>“Yes; took a hand at the pumps,” said Joel,
thinking it unnecessary to relate that he had
been at them ever since.</p>

<p>“Oh, my poor boy!” cried Phronsie, taking
his face in her hands. “Joel, Mamsie would
be glad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“Phronsie, I’m going back. It can be kept
under, I think, from the worst, till morning.
The people must not know, for all of us would
be lost then in the row they’d make.” He was
whispering hoarsely, and Phronsie laid her hand
over his mouth, “Hush, dear, I know,” she
said.</p>

<p>“There are life-preservers in your rooms,” Joel
glanced quickly at hers, “and you know how
to get them on if anything <i>suddenly</i> should
happen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Joey dear.”</p>

<p>“But I shall be back to you—never fear
about that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Joey.”</p>

<small>ARE THEY ALL SAFE?</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PHRONSIE thought a moment, and then said
to herself, “Yes, I think I better bring her
here, and then we will all be together.” So slipping
out of her stateroom, she went hurriedly,
making her way with difficulty, as the distance
was a good one, and the ship rolled badly, to
old Mrs. Benson’s door. “Mrs. Benson,” she said,
gently rapping, “it is I, Phronsie Pepper.”</p>

<p>“Yes, deary.” The little old lady was not
asleep, but lay in a happy doze, in which she was
living over again all the beautiful days in her
little English cottage with her lads about her.
“Yes, deary; I’ll be there in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Please hurry, Mrs. Benson,” begged Phronsie.</p>

<p>“And so I will,” said old Mrs. Benson; and
presently she opened the door, and appeared before
Phronsie in a short gown and petticoat, her
white hair tucked under a frilled nightcap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“Anything happened, deary?” she asked anxiously,
looking up into Phronsie’s face.</p>

<p>Phronsie drew her in softly to the middle of
the stateroom, and closed the door. “Dear Mrs.
Benson,” she said, taking her hands,—“I want
you to go with me to my stateroom, so that we
can all be near each other.”</p>

<p>“And so I will, deary, if you want me to,”
said the old woman obediently; “but what is
the matter? Has anything happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Phronsie; “but don’t make a
noise, for the men are working hard to save us
all, and the people are not to know yet, for they
would be so frightened we should all be lost.”
She held her mouth close to the cap-frills. “The
ship is on fire!”</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Benson broke away from her with
a deep groan, and fell on her knees by the berth.
“Oh, my pretty lads, my pretty lads!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Benson,” said Phronsie, laying a hand
on the thin shoulders, “there isn’t a moment
to lose, for I cannot be away from Grandpapa.
I must go back at once, and you must go with
me; come.”</p>

<p>“The Lord forgive me for keeping you,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
the old lady, staggering to her feet; “now, deary,
I’m ready.”</p>

<p>“You better put your dress on,” said Phronsie.</p>

<p>“No, deary; I’ll not wait for anything, or
keep you a minute longer. I’ll go as I am.”
She glanced back around the room, as if bidding
everything good-by; then picked up a little picture
on the table, and tucked it into her bosom.</p>

<p>“We must take this,” said Phronsie, pulling
out the life-preserver quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the little old woman with a shiver.</p>

<p>“And you better lock your door,” said Phronsie,
“and take the key, Mrs. Benson.”</p>

<p>“All right, deary,” said the old woman with
another good-by glance. They were on their way
to Phronsie’s stateroom, when suddenly the cry
arose, “Fire! Fire!” and a heavy body staggered
by them, pushing them to right and to left, as
he lunged against each stateroom door with a
thud, screaming, “Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p>“Oh, hurry, hurry, Mrs. Benson!” exclaimed
Phronsie, helping her along. The little old lady
sank helplessly to the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, deary!” she moaned; “it’s struck
me here,” laying her hand on her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Then I must carry you,” said Phronsie desperately.</p>

<p>By this time the passage was filling with
smoke, and a hoarse babel of sounds, like a distant
roar, broke upon their ears.</p>

<p>A man, one of the crew, ran by so roughly
that he brushed Phronsie’s cheek with his arm.
“Oh, please carry this poor woman to my stateroom!”
she cried to him.</p>

<p class="caption">“The sailor roared out, ‘The ship’s on fire!’ and was plunging on.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Leave me, leave me, deary,” the little old
lady was saying. “Good-by, deary; oh, leave
the old woman and save yourself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>The sailor roared out, “The ship’s on fire!”
and was plunging on.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Phronsie; “oh, carry her
for me, please!” The hood of her cloak fell
back, and she clasped her hands entreatingly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know ’twas you,” exclaimed the
sailor, looking at her for the first time; “you’re
the one that writ me the letter to my folks.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Phronsie.</p>

<p>He seized old Mrs. Benson, and swung her to
his shoulder, “Come,” he cried to Phronsie,
“they’re to lower the boats; I’ll save ye both.”</p>

<p>“I must go to Grandpapa,” cried Phronsie,
“save her;” and dashed off by herself.</p>

<p>“No use,” roared the sailor roughly, “you’ll
all be lost together. Come this way;” but he
followed her with an oath, with the little old
lady.</p>

<p>Stateroom doors were being flung open, and
heads thrust out. Now and then a woman
screamed, and men were shouting and cursing.
And above it all that dreadful roar and the
blinding smoke!</p>

<p>“Grandpapa! O Grandpapa!” cried Phronsie,
reaching the door and kneeling at it, “O Grandpapa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
please hurry, and open the door to Phronsie!”</p>

<p>“Leave away,” cried the sailor, dropping the
little old lady, and pushing Phronsie aside. Then
he backed off, and dashed at the door with his
fist.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is that?” called old Mr. King, sitting
straight in his berth.</p>

<p>“Let me in, Grandpapa dear!” begged Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Er—oh—why, Phronsie, child!” Old Mr.
King threw wide the door, and drew her to her
feet with a hasty hand.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” cried Phronsie, “there is not
an instant to lose—the ship is on fire, Grandpapa.
Quick! get his life-preserver,” to the
sailor.</p>

<p>Old Mr. King put up a hasty hand, “Not till
you have on yours, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“No nonsense!” roared the sailor at him, dragging
out the life-preserver to fling it over the
handsome white head.</p>

<p>“I’ll get mine in a minute,” cried Phronsie,
fastening old Mrs. Benson’s to her trembling
figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>The rushing of feet, the babel of hoarse cries,
the awful roar, and the stifling smoke made it
well-nigh impossible for them to see and to hear
each other. Phronsie knew that the sailor was
securing a life-preserver around her; and then,
above all the awful confusion, she heard a
voice.</p>

<p>“Joel!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I’ll take her,” cried Joel, “and the other
one. Do you look out, Jim, for the old gentleman.
To the boats, my man, to the boats!”</p>

<p>He gathered Phronsie up, and old Mrs. Benson
too, the sailor picking up Mr. King; and
never any of them could tell how, but presently
they were in the wild confusion of the hurrying
throngs, and crowded in together at the side of
the ship, where they were lowering the boats.</p>

<p>And here Joel leaped away.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are,” he commanded them;
drawing his revolver as he sprang to the captain’s
side, who single-handed was trying to keep
the half-crazed crew from leaping into the boat.</p>

<p>“I’ll shoot the first man of you who drops
into that boat,” yelled Joel at the crew. In their
wild fury to get first at the boats as they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
lowered, they were knocking the passengers to
right and left in their craze. When they saw
him, and knew it was the same man who had
worked at their side for nine long hours, they
sullenly gave up and backed away.</p>

<p class="caption">“‘I must go to Grandpapa,’ cried Phronsie, ‘save her;’ and dashed off
by herself.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I think I’ll go in this boat, don’t you know,”
said a voice close to them.</p>

<p>“O Livingston! don’t go and leave me.” There
was no drawl now in the shrill, thin voice. “O
Miss Pepper, save me! save me!” clutching
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Take your hands off,” roared Joel at her,
pulling Phronsie away from her grasp. “No
Bayley, the women and children and old people
must go first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” shrieked Mrs. Bayley, wild with
terror; “oh, save me somebody! I’ll give any
one a thousand dollars to save me,” she screamed.
She had her jewels in a small bag, which she
huddled up to her bosom. But no one heard
her, as all rushed on, trampling down the weaker
ones, to get at the boats.</p>

<p>“Is Grandpapa in?” cried Phronsie, as Joel
lifted her high, and handed her over to Jim’s long
arms ahead.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Benson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“O Joel—<i>you</i>!” she cried as she was swung
off, and felt herself drop, drop, to be caught by
other strong arms. She lifted her eyes, her yellow
hair streaming away from her face as she
called him; and he turned his begrimed and haggard
one at her an instant as he smiled, and continued
to help the women down.</p>

<p>“This boat is full—not another soul comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
on,” cried the sailors shoving off, as a woman,
more dead than alive, was dropped in.</p>

<p>Phronsie looked up at Joel; he waved his hand
at her, and she turned and threw her arms around
Grandpapa’s neck.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The ship’s surgeon bent over the handsome
white-haired old gentleman with the young girl
clinging to his neck. They had brought them on
together in that way when picked up, drifting
aimlessly in an open boat, the exhausted sailors
drooping over their oars. He listened carefully
for their breathing while he applied all the restoratives,
but they seemed to have passed on over
the tide together.</p>

<p>“Oh, my deary; let me try!” It was the little
old woman whom they brought up next, sodden
with the salt spray, and laid down beside them.
She raised herself by a violent effort, and threw
her wet hands over Phronsie’s white face. “Oh,
my lamb—quick, doctor, now! See, her eyes are
moving—oh, my pretty deary!”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” said Phronsie feebly.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lamb,” cried old Mrs. Benson in the
energy of hope; “see, she is coming to!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>But Dr. Ransom knew he had a far more difficult
case before him to work back the receding
life into the old body; and he left her to the
woman’s care while he applied the restoratives
to Mr. King.</p>

<p>“Lend a hand here, will you?” cried Mrs. Benson
to a woman who had not ceased to bemoan the
loss of her possessions since she had been put, the
last passenger, in the boat before they swept off;
“do you rub her feet, while I chafe her hands—oh,
my lamb!”</p>

<p>“I cannot do anything,” exclaimed the woman
petulantly, and turning away her head, as she
huddled up against the cabin sofa; “my heart is
broken. I’ve lost all—all—and at the last some
villain twitched away my bag of jewels. Oh! what
shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Do you talk of jewels,” cried old Mrs. Benson
at her, her eyes blazing underneath her white hair,
“at such a time as this—oh, my lamb!” chafing
busily the cold hands.</p>

<p>“And I really cannot help you,” whined the
other, “for I am nearly dead myself.”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa!” Phronsie opened her eyes, and
put her hand weakly up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>“Yes, yes, deary,” said the old woman comfortingly.
“Has he come to?” her lips framing the
words over to the surgeon.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lord! Yes, yes, deary. There, there,
my lamb.”</p>

<p>“Where is Grandpapa?” asked Phronsie
faintly.</p>

<p>“He’s right here, my pretty lamb,” said the
old woman, her hot tears raining down on Phronsie’s
cold face.</p>

<p>Phronsie gave a sigh of relief. “Joel,” she
tried to say, but the sounds died away in her
throat.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! I wish somebody would take
care of me,” complained the person on the sofa.
“My dear woman, now that Miss Pepper is all
right, will you give me a little attention? I am
wringing wet, and as cold as ice.”</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Benson never turned her head. One
of the sailors looked in. “Bring me some hot
water,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, my good sir!” exclaimed the other woman,
springing up to a sitting posture, “will you come
here? I want you this instant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“Bring the hot water!” commanded Mrs. Benson—and
he disappeared.</p>

<p>“I do not suppose you know who I am, you
ignorant, low-down woman,” cried the other passionately.
“I am Mrs. Livingston Bayley of
New York, now of Bayley Manor, England. Now
will you cease your insults to me?”</p>

<p>“Any change?”</p>

<p>The surgeon’s lips framed the word “no,” as he
turned his face an instant; in a second he darted
back like lightning, and seized a spoonful of restorative
which he held to the white lips. A
long-drawn sigh, faint but distinct, was heard.
Old Mrs. Benson hid her face on Phronsie’s arm
and cried like a child—this time for joy.</p>

a happy face.</p>

<p>Barby glanced up from her play on the floor
and saw her so, and immediately dropped everything

Polly’s side.</p>

<p>“Mummy,” cried Barby, wriggling along till

closely, and turning a happy face. “Barby, <i>do</i>
you know that dear Grandpapa and Aunt Phronsie
and Uncle Joel are probably safe on the other
side now. <i>Do</i> you know it, Barbara?”</p>

<p>“You called her Barbara,” said Elyot from
the floor, and relinquishing the charms of a castle
ready to receive its final tower, to look over at
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“I know it,” said Polly happily. “When
everything is so beautiful, Elyot, I must call my
little girl by her own true name—her papa’s
dear mamma’s name. O Barbara, Barbara!” exclaimed
Polly with a final kiss.</p>

<p>“And when she’s bad, you call her Barbara,”
said Elyot thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“And that is to make my little girl grow up
good and beautiful like her dear grandmamma,”
said Polly. “Children, you don’t know how
beautiful your papa’s mamma was; everybody
who ever saw her says so.”</p>

<p>“She’s down-stairs in the drawing-room,” said
Elyot, as if stating a wholly new fact for the
first time; “and when I go in, I run up and kiss
her dress, and say, ‘How do you do, grandmamma,’
and she smiles at me.”</p>

<p>“And I say, ‘Boo, grandmamma!’” laughed
Barby confidentially.</p>

<p>“Well, if the picture is so beautiful,” said
Polly, “you must remember that dear grandmamma
was ever so much more beautiful herself.
And she was good and lovely all through,
dears.”</p>

<p>“Here comes a man to our house,” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
Barby, leaning over Polly’s arms to look out of
the window.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="illus_p324">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p324.jpg" alt="And I say, ‘Boo, grandmamma!’">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“And I say, ‘Boo, grandmamma!’ laughed Barby confidentially.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“It’s Mr. Ferguson,” said Polly, glancing over
Barby’s shoulder. “I suppose he has come out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
on the early train. Oh! your papa, dear, will
come next train, I verily believe; and then, children,
perhaps he will have a cablegram from
Grandpapa and Aunt Phronsie and Uncle Joel.
Just think!”</p>

<p>The maid stood before her saying, “Mr. Ferguson
is down-stairs, Mrs. King, and he wants
to see you at once.”</p>

<p>So Polly put Barby down, and hurried off.
“Go back, dears,” as they rushed along the
upper hall after her.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson, their next neighbor a half-mile
or so down the road, stood in the wide hall nervously
twirling his hat.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come in?” asked Mrs. King.</p>

<p>“N—no, I thank you,” said Mr. Ferguson,
edging off to the big front door. “I just called
going by from the train. I thought you ought
to know, and there wasn’t any time to go to
Mr. King’s office and tell him.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Polly quietly.</p>

<p>“It’s on the bulletin-board,” said Mr. Ferguson,
twirling his hat worse than ever—“they
were putting it out when I went by for the
train—I thought you ought to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>Polly felt everything swim before her eyes;
but she looked steadily in his face, and clasped
her hands tightly together.</p>

<p>“It’s on the bulletin-board,” repeated Mr. Ferguson,
“that the Llewellyn was burned at sea;
but the passengers were picked up by one of
the Harris line of cattle steamers,” he hurried
on as he saw her face, “and carried to Liverpool.”</p>

<p>“Is that <i>all</i>?” gasped Polly hoarsely.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson looked into his hat, and then
gasped out, “N—no; but perhaps it isn’t true,
Mrs. King. It said that the Rev. Joel Pepper
was among the lost. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Polly ran through the hall, and out the side
door. “<i>Jasper, Jasper!</i>” she was saying over
and over in her heart, though her white lips did
not move. Would she never reach the little
brown house! At last she was speeding up the
narrow path and over the well-worn flat stone,
and through the old doorway and on into the
bedroom, where she threw herself on her knees
by Mamsie’s big four-poster, just as she had
thrown herself years ago. “Dear God!” she
cried now, her face buried in the gay, patched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
bedquilt, just as it had been on that afternoon
so long ago, when in that darkened room, her
eyes shadowed by a fear of blindness, they had
told her of the worse shadow that hung over
Joel, “make me willing to have anything—yes,
<i>anything</i> happen; only make me good.”</p>

<p class="caption">Polly threw herself on her knees by Mamsie’s big four-poster.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How long she knelt there she never knew.
Jasper hurried through the old kitchen, and
found her so. “O Polly!” kneeling by her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
side, he cried, “don’t, don’t, dear! We have
each other.”</p>

<p>“O Jasper!” Polly turned, and threw her
arms around his neck, burying her face on his
breast as he gathered her up closely. “I was
going out to watch for you,” she cried remorsefully.</p>

<p>“I’ve only just got home, and they told me
you were over here. I’d rather find you here,
Polly,” he hastened to add, as he saw her face.</p>

<p>And then Polly smiled, “We have each other,
and God, Jasper,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jasper; “and as long as I can say
that, Polly, I can bear everything else.”</p>

<p>There was a step outside in the old kitchen;
Jasper sprang to his feet, Polly by his side.</p>

<p>“It is only I, children,” said Mr. Marlowe.</p>

<p>So they ran out to him, getting him into the
easiest chair, and trying to comfort him; for although
he said nothing, it was easy to see how
he was suffering. And sitting one each side,
they took a hand and patted it softly between
their own.</p>

<p>“I came as soon as I knew,” Mr. Marlowe was
saying quietly; “can I do anything to help? Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
you wired Ben and David? It’s better for them
to hear it first from you.”</p>

<p>“No,” cried Jasper, starting to his feet; “I
forgot it.”</p>

<p>“He thought only of me,” cried Polly.</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to it,” said Mr. Marlowe, getting
up quickly; “on the way to the train I cabled to
Liverpool for full particulars.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you are!” cried Jasper and
Polly together.</p>

<p>“But they will cable you from Liverpool probably
before this is answered,” said Mr. Marlowe;
“so keep up heart, children.”</p>

<p>“They?” Polly dared not even think “Father”
and “Phronsie,” as she clung to Jasper. “Yes,
dear Mr. Marlowe,” she said with a smile, as
he went out.</p>

<p>He came striding in presently, his keen gray
eyes alight. “I believe it is good,” he said, handing
a yellow envelope to Jasper; “this has just
come.”</p>

<p>Jasper tore it open, one arm around Polly, and
together they cried, “Oh, <i>they’re safe</i>, Mr. Marlowe—all
of them—<i>Joey and all—safe</i>!”</p>

<p>Mr. Marlowe picked up the yellow sheet as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
dropped from their hands. With a glance like
lightning down the page, he gave it back, and
rushed off. “I’ll telegraph to the boys,” they
heard him say, as he shot out the doorway.</p>

<p>Polly seized the cablegram hungrily, and dropped
a kiss on it. Then over and over they read the
blissful words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Liverpool.</span></p>

<p>We are safe. Joel and the captain and a sailor named
Jim were the last to leave the ship. Joel was hurt, but
not seriously. Grandpapa was exhausted, but in a day or
two we shall leave for Rome. Joel insists on it. He is to
stay here a little longer, at the house of a good friend, Mr.
Henry Benson, thirty-seven Harley Street.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Sophronia Pepper.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“Now, you two children are going in the next
boat to Liverpool,” Mr. Marlowe hurried in with
a smile—“if you can catch it;” and he began to
rummage in the newspaper-folder behind the door.
“Let’s see; yes, Thursday the Abyssinia sails;
day after to-morrow—plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Marlowe, I cannot be spared,” cried
Jasper, aghast. “And as long as everything seems
to be so well over there, I ought not to leave
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have my say now, Jasper,” declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
the publisher deliberately, and drawing up
his chair to their side. “To be sure, all is right,
thank God, over there; but Polly wants to see
Joel for herself, and you need it, too, after all this
anxiety; and then you are to go on to Rome, and
look after them all there.”</p>

<p>“O Mr. Marlowe!” Polly and Jasper turned,
and gazed into each other’s faces. This was too
good to be true.</p>

<p>“You are sacrificing yourself,” said Jasper brokenly.
“Stop—don’t say a word, sir, I know
just what is to be done; and my work must come
on you. No, no, it isn’t right; I cannot go and
leave you; Polly wouldn’t wish it under such conditions.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Polly, throwing her arm around him;
“indeed, I do not wish it, dear Mr. Marlowe. I
wouldn’t go for anything.”</p>

<p>“Listen, now, Polly,” Mr. Marlowe turned his
face with a smile toward her; “you are both
like my children, aren’t you?” looking at Jasper
now.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, we are,” they both cried.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’m going to be obeyed,” he said,
getting a hand of each, and keeping them close.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
“Now, hear me. You are wife and child and
everything to me, and it is my happiness to look
out for you. Don’t go against my plan, children.
Remember, I’m all alone in the world,
and don’t thwart me in this.” He set his lips
firmly together, while his keen gray eyes held
them.</p>

<p>“But, sir”—began Jasper.</p>

<p>“No, no, Jasper, it won’t do. I’ve planned
it all coming out on the train. I can get Jacobs;
he’s out of a job now. He can take some of
the detail work you look after, so that I shall
not carry that. And I should only worry if
you stayed at home. You must go.” Mr. Marlowe
took away his good right hand a moment
from Polly’s, to bring it down quickly on his
knee.</p>

<p>“Can you get Jacobs?” asked Jasper joyfully.</p>

<p>“Yes; heard so to-day. I was going to ask
you if we better not secure him anyway. So
you see the way is open for you to be off.”</p>

<p>“But there is plenty more that Jacobs cannot
do, Mr. Marlowe,” began Jasper anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333-334]</span></p>

<p class="caption">“‘Of course,’ cried Polly, with kindling eyes, ‘splendid old Joel
would do just that very thing, Davie.’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>“Never mind; I shall plan it so that you’re
not to worry. You must go, Jasper;” and looking
in the resolute face with its shining eyes,
they knew it was a settled thing that in two
days, if all went well, they would be off.</p>

<p>And on the next day David came rushing in,
breathless with pride and excitement. “I’m going
to Joel,” he panted.</p>

<p>“Why, David,” Polly cried at him, “oh, you
dear boy! Can you?”</p>

<p>“Can I?” cried David. “Nothing in all this
world is strong enough to keep me from him.
To think that Joel stayed till the very last. O
Polly!”</p>

<p>“I know it,” cried Polly with kindling eyes;
“but of course splendid old Joel would do just
that very thing, Davie.” She was hugging his
hands now, and laughing and crying together.
“Jasper!” she called, hurrying into the wide hall,
“David has—oh, oh—Ben!” she screamed.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” cried Jasper running up, “you
here, Ben?”</p>

<p>“And David,” cried Polly, quite overcome,
and laying her head on Ben’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here, of course,” said David, coming
out into the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>“Jasper!” cried Ben, his honest eyes shining
with pride, and reaching past Polly to give
him a handshake such as Ben only could give,
“run your hand in my coat pocket here; there’s
a paper, the <i>Press-Bulletin</i>—it’s all in there
about Joe.”</p>

<p>“And I have it in mine,” cried David, whirling
out a big journal; “here, Jasper, read mine
first.” He shook it in Jasper’s face.</p>

<p>“Softly, there,” cried Jasper just as excited.
“Polly, hold one of these fellows—take Dave
there—while I get this paper out of Ben’s pocket.”</p>

<p>“Polly read mine—read it,” implored Davie.
So Polly deserted Ben, and fastened her brown
eyes on the sheet Davie held for her, and Jasper
read his out too; and no one who hadn’t
learned it before could hear a word of it all,—how
the Rev. Joel Pepper had worked for nine
long hours with the sailors to subdue the fire;
and when it was found that the ship couldn’t
be saved, he it was who kept by the captain’s
side and maintained order, so that everybody
got off. And then, at the very last, those three—the
captain and the Rev. Joel and a sailor
named Jim—had jumped for their lives; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
the cattle steamer, after picking up the boat-loads,
had come to their rescue, to discover them
floating on broken spars. And the clergyman
was injured, but was recovering in Liverpool.
And Mr. Horatio King and his grand-daughter
were passengers. Oh, and it was a marvel that
no lives were lost! And then followed glowing
praises of Joel.</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” cried Ben and Davie, pounding
for order. “One or the other of you stop.” And
in ran Alexia and Pickering.</p>

<p>“Oh! what is it?” cried Alexia, rushing up to
Polly.</p>

<p>“They are so excited they don’t know what
they’re reading,” cried Davie.</p>

<p>“Oh, splendid old Joel!” breathed Polly, turning
with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Good for Joe!” cried Jasper, beginning afresh
on his column.</p>

<p>“Give it to me, Polly! give it to me!” exclaimed
Alexia, trying to get hold of the sheet. But Polly
only whirled away with it, reading happily on.</p>

<p>“Well, that is too splendid for anything,” cried
Jasper, throwing down the newspaper at last,
“Oh, hello, you here, Pick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>“So you’ve waked up, have you,” cried Pickering,
pouncing on the journal, and edging off into a
corner with it. “Then I’ll have a go at it myself.”
Alexia seeing this, deserted Polly, and ran
over to him.</p>

<p>“Just one little teenty corner of a scrap,” she
said, laying hold of one edge.</p>

<p>“Get away,” said Pickering, holding fast to it.
“I can tell you so much quicker, Alexia, than you
can read it.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have one corner,” she begged.
“Oh, what a mean shame!” as Pickering turned a
cold shoulder to her.</p>

<p>“He’s a shabby little beggar,” said Ben, flying
around suddenly to grasp the newspaper; “there,
hold your hands, Alexia. I’ll hold <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I call taking advantage of the
defenceless,” said Pickering, defrauded of his
paper. “Ben, you’re a nice friend, to turn
against me like that.”</p>

<p>“Come over here, and I’ll let you have part,”
said Alexia sweetly; and seating herself on
a divan, she was soon reading as excitedly as
Polly.</p>

<p>“Oh! where has she gone?” she cried at last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
jumping up, and dashing the newspaper to the
floor. “Where’s Polly gone?”</p>

<p>“And Jasper too,” said Ben. “Goodness me!”
as the door opened, and in came Polly and the two
children, Elyot hanging to his father’s hand.</p>

<p>“I want these blessed dears to hear it—all about
their Uncle Joel now, just as soon as we read it,”
said Polly with shining eyes. So everybody had
to go all over it again, the children hanging on
every word.</p>

<small>THE REST OF THE PEPPERS ARE OFF.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">“I OUGHT not to say anything,” cried Alexia,
twisting around a very damp handkerchief
in her nervous fingers.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Fargo; “I don’t think you had,
Alexia.”</p>

<p>“But what shall we do when this great place is
empty of Peppers?” Alexia rolled her eyes up to
the vaulted ceiling. They were in the music-room
waiting for Polly, who had gone up-stairs for a list
of people to whom notes must be written announcing
her sudden departure.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to think of it,” said Mrs. Fargo
helplessly; “but we ought not to say one word to
let Polly see how sorry we are they must go.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, I haven’t said a word!” cried Alexia
in a very injured way. “Here I’ve been just killing
myself to keep it all in, Mrs. Fargo. I
should think you’d compliment me. But no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
ever does. And to think that Grace is going
too. Dear me, I shall just rattle around in my
old pumpkin-shell too lonely for anything.”</p>

<p>“You must come over here, and cheer me
up,” said Mrs. Fargo, who was to move from
the farmer’s house over to “The Oaks,” with
Johnny, to stay till Polly and Jasper’s return
with the children. “Well, I’m glad for my
part that Grace’s mother had sense enough to
telegraph back ‘yes,’ and that she is going; she’ll
see her cousin, Roslyn May, besides being with
the Peppers. It will be a good thing for Grace.”</p>

<p>“King said he wasn’t going without Grace,”
said Alexia; “he’s awfully fond of her—and I
don’t wonder. Oh, dear me! just think of all those
children going away just as my blessed baby had
got so he could talk and play with them!”</p>

<p>“Why, they won’t be gone more than a month
or six weeks probably,” said Mrs. Fargo. “They
can’t be, for it’s as much as Mr. Marlowe could
do to get Jasper to go anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, oh, dear me!” said Alexia, beginning
again on her handkerchief. “I can’t do without
Polly Pepper a week. We—goodness, here
she comes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>Polly came hurrying in, a long list in her
hand.</p>

<p>“Come into the library, please,” she said.
“Oh, you are both so good to do this!”</p>

<p>Alexia sniffed softly as she followed her, making
Mrs. Fargo go between; then she gave a
final dab to her eyes, and resolutely stuffed her
handkerchief in her pocket. “Gracious me,
Polly!” she said, hurrying into a chair, and bending
her head so that Polly should not see her
red eyes, “that’s nothing; we’ll do it all—now
hunt us up something else to fly at when this
is done.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing,” said Polly, “that
troubles me.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Polly?” asked Mrs. Fargo.</p>

<p>And Alexia forgot all about her red eyes, and
raced out of her chair, to run around the big
table and peer into Polly’s brown ones.</p>

<p>“It’s Grandma Bascom,” said Polly. “I hate
to leave her. Mrs. Higby will look after her
splendidly; it isn’t that; but she wants somebody
to go in just as we have every day, and
talk to her, and read to her, and cheer her up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” cried Alexia gustily, and falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
back. “I can’t take all your old women,
Polly Pepper—and they wouldn’t like me, either.
They’d tell me to go out of the house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they wouldn’t, Alexia!” said Polly
with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, they would,” contradicted Alexia before
she could stop herself; “they’d want to fling
things at me. I don’t know how to talk to horrible
old women, Polly; you know I don’t.”</p>

<p>“And I’m not much better,” said Mrs. Fargo,
wrinkling her forehead in perplexity.</p>

<p>Polly stood quite still, her hand on the top of
the oaken chair.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t look like that,” exclaimed Alexia,
taking one glance at the troubled face, “and I’ll
go there every day; I’ll sit on the front door-step
from morning to night. I’ll do anything,
Polly Pepper—Polly, did you hear?” running
up to shake her arm.</p>

<p>“You might take Baby in with you,” said
Polly, turning a brightening face.</p>

<p>“So I could,” cried Alexia radiantly. “I
never thought of that. Oh! I’ll go in every
single day. Don’t you worry about that, Polly.
Promise, now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>She put her two hands on Polly’s shoulders,
and kissed her till Polly’s cheeks were as red
as two roses; then she spun her around till they
both were quite out of breath.</p>

<p>“There, I feel better now!” said Alexia, releasing
her and panting; “we haven’t had such
a spin since we were girls together. And to
think of us two old things. Oh, dear, I’ve lost
all my hairpins!” She put up one hand to her
head, while she sank to the floor, and groped
with the other under the chairs and the table.</p>

<p>“I think we sha’n’t get this list done very
quickly,” observed Mrs. Fargo, writing away.</p>

<p>“Oh, misery me! Well, what can I do?”
wailed Alexia, sitting on the floor, her bright
eyes searching the carpet; “here’s one—that’s
good, and that’s another,” pouncing on them;
“there, I’ll let the others be, and pick ’em up
afterward. Here goes;” and pinning up her hair
as best she could, she rushed into her seat, to send
her pen scratching wildly over Polly’s notes.</p>

<p>“Anybody would know who wrote that,” she
said, viewing the first one with great disfavor.
“Dear me, I wish I could write like you, Mrs.
Fargo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>“I write plainly,” said Mrs. Fargo, well pleased
at the compliment; “and that’s all I can say,
Alexia.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear! do talk,” presently cried Alexia,
“or I shall begin again on the old subject. Oh,
good! here’s Ben,” as he came in.</p>

<p>“Writing Polly’s notes?” he asked, his eyes
lighting up in a pleased way.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Alexia, as usual answering first;
“and there are such a lot of them—Mrs. Coyle
Campbell’s luncheon next week to get out of.
I’m just finishing that, and a hundred other engagements,
and all sorts of things. Go on and
talk, Ben, do, about something. I’m in a bad
temper enough, and I want to be amused, or I
shall spoil half of these.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Ben leisurely,
and sitting down to laugh at her. “Well, I only
wish there was anything I could do to help.
But I’ve been wandering the house over, and
there isn’t a thing I’m fit for.”</p>

<p>“How’s Charlotte Chatterton?” asked Alexia
suddenly; “seems to me we don’t hear much
from her lately. I suppose you’ll all find her
abroad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>Not receiving any answer, she looked up, her
sharp eyes resting on Ben’s face in surprise.</p>

<p>“She’s well, I suppose,” he began. Alexia
laid down her pen in astonishment, and stared
at him. The color was in his cheeks like a
girl’s, and he began to fumble the little envelopes.</p>

<p>“Well, if I can’t help, I won’t at least hinder
you,” he said at last with a short laugh, and
getting up, he went out.</p>

<p>Alexia deserted her chair, and ran around to
Mrs. Fargo’s.</p>

<p>“Did you see? O Mrs. Fargo! did you see?”
she cried, shaking that lady’s arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! now I’ve gone and put a ‘g’
on Mrs. Crowninshield’s name,” exclaimed Mrs.
Fargo in vexation. “You shook me just then,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“Never mind your ‘g’s’,” said Alexia coolly;
“what’s a ‘g’ in such bliss as this? O Mrs.
Fargo, did you see Ben Pepper?” She hung
over her now in great excitement.</p>

<p>“No; I’m sure I didn’t notice him,” said
Mrs. Fargo, trying to erase the “g”; and making
it worse, she gave up the note entirely. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
I wish you’d go back to your own seat, Alexia,”
she added decidedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I must tell you this!” cried Alexia; “it’s
my duty to, if you didn’t see it for yourself, Mrs.
Fargo; Ben Pepper,—don’t you see? Oh, how
perfectly splendid!” She jumped up, and clapped
her hands in glee.</p>

<p>“Alexia Dodge,” began Mrs. Fargo. But as
well talk to the north wind.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, Ben Pepper is in love with
Charlotte—O Mrs. Fargo! we’ve been blind and
stupid as owls not to see it before; but then, she’s
been gone so long.”</p>

<p>“I can’t call you a goose, Alexia,” observed
Mrs. Fargo, laying down her pen in despair; “for
you never were a goose, whatever else you are.
But this time you’ve made a mistake, my dear,
a very great mistake.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see!” cried Alexia triumphantly; “I
shall just tell Polly to watch Ben as a cat would
a mouse.”</p>

<p>“You better watch these notes,” cried Mrs.
Fargo irately, “for they won’t be done by the
time Polly comes back;” which had the effect of
sending Alexia into her chair again, where her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
pen fairly flew to the tune of the new thought she
had gotten into her head.</p>

<p>Ben kept out of her way so successfully, that although
she dodged after him at all sorts of times,
he always slipped around some angle, or out of a
door, leaving Alexia to stare at the bare walls.
At last, particularly as there were many little
things she found to her great delight that she
could do for Polly, she gave it up in despair.
And finding David alone for a moment after dinner,
she besieged him with questions.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Davie, now like a good boy; isn’t
Ben going to marry Charlotte Chatterton?”</p>

<p>David drew a long breath; but he wasn’t to be
caught this way, so he said coolly, “I hope so,
Alexia; can’t you fix matters up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you incorrigible boy!” cried Alexia; “you
know the secret, I do believe, and you won’t tell.
I think you might tell <i>me</i>,” she added wheedlingly.</p>

<p>“Ask Ben.”</p>

<p>“I know he is. No need to ask him. Now,
David, do you know?”</p>

<p>David assumed a very wise look; then he said,
“You can guess at such questions if you like, but
I never do. Ask me something easier, Alexia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>“Well, I think you are just dreadful!” cried
Alexia in despair. “Oh, dear me, and to-morrow
night you’ll all be miles and miles away, and me
left here without Polly!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next morning she turned from the small
station after the cars had borne away the little
group bound for the steamer. “For I can’t ever
bid her good-by again on the boat,” she had said
to Pickering. “I tried that once in the old days
you know, and it made me feel a great deal
worse. Come, Mrs. Fargo,” she said, holding out
her hand.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked that lady,
pausing with her foot on the step of the King carriage.</p>

<p>“Down to that old Mrs. Bascom’s,” said Alexia,
trying to look pleasant, and hoping no one would
look at her, for she was dreadfully afraid she
should cry. “I must begin at once, or I never
shall get there.”</p>

<p>“You go to-day, and I will try it to-morrow,”
said Mrs. Fargo.</p>

<p>So Alexia jumped desperately into her little
dog-cart, and drove furiously down to the cottage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
just around Primrose Lane, feeling with each revolution
of the wheels how those other wheels were
bearing Polly on and on, away from her.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“‘She’s gone; and I don’t never ’xpect to live to see her again, nor
him, nor those pretty creeters,’ went on Grandma.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Come in,” said Grandma Bascom, to the rap
which she gave with her whip-handle on the little
old door.</p>

<p>“How do you do to-day?” asked Alexia. Then
she saw that the old lady had been crying.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry for you,” she cried, laying her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
hand in its neat driving-glove on the poor
withered one; while,—“She’s gone, and I don’t
never ’xpect to live to see her again, nor him,
nor those pretty creeters,” went on Grandma.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will!” said Alexia, gulping down
something in her throat. “Well, now, Grandma,
I’m coming in to see you every day.”</p>

<p>“Hey?” cried Grandma.</p>

<p>So Alexia had to bend her tall figure so that
she could scream it all over into Grandma’s
ear; and this pleased the old lady so much, to
think she was going to have company besides
Mrs. Higby, that Alexia in great satisfaction
pulled up a chair to the bedside, and began to
tell all about the getting off, and what Polly
said, and how she came running back the last
thing after she had bidden her good-by to say
over again, “Now, Alexia, remember dear Grandma
Bascom.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the pretty creeter!” cried the old lady,
quite overcome. And then Alexia rattled off
what everybody else said, and how the children
had each sent a kiss apiece to her, and what
Ben and David did, and all about Jasper, till
she was quite spent with her efforts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>“Though I don’t suppose she heard more than
one word in ten,” Alexia told Pickering in relating
the events of the day at dinner; “but
her cap bobbed all the while, and she kept saying,
‘Yes, deary.’ And then, when I got through,
she wanted to know what Joel did, and everything
that people said about him, and the whole
thing from beginning to end.”</p>

<p>“You better be prepared to tell that story
every day; for depend upon it, Alexia, she’ll
ask you for it,” said Pickering.</p>

<small>ALL TOGETHER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MRS. BENSON,” said Joel, regarding her
fixedly, “they used to say of me in the
old days, that I was perfectly dreadful when I
was sick, to make them stand round, you know,
and all that. Now, I know you won’t say that,
will you?” he asked wheedlingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the little old lady, shaking
her head at her minister. “You do get
your own way somehow or other, sir.”</p>

<p>Joel burst into a loud laugh, then he pulled
himself up.</p>

<p>“Jim,” he said, “I’m dreadfully abused by
them all, am I not, my fine fellow?” to a man
in the corner.</p>

<p>“Hey, sir?” said Jim, coming forward.</p>

<p>“I say I’m most dreadfully abused,” cried
Joel. “Now, I’m going to get up out of this
bed,” giving a smart kick to the clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>“And I say you mustn’t,” cried the little old
lady in alarm, and running, both hands full of
dishes which she cast on a table on her way.
“Hold down the clothes, Jim, that side; oh!
what would the doctor say?”</p>

<p>“A fig for the doctor!” cried Joel with another
lunge, that brought all the clothes clear
away from both sides. “Now, Jim, hand me my
toggery, and help me into it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” cried little Mrs. Benson, finding
the clothes twitched out of her hands, beginning
now to wring them together. “What shall we
do? Son Henry has gone to his store, or I’d
call him.”</p>

<p>“And ‘son Henry’ couldn’t do a bit of good
if he were here,” observed Joel calmly; and, sitting
on the side of the bed, he issued orders for
his raiment, to right and to left, to Jim. “No,
Mother Benson, I’m not going to be caught by
all my family, after they cabled they were to
start—why, they may be here to-morrow, and
I tucked into bed like a sick baby. No, indeed,
ma’am! Why, I’m as well as a fish.”</p>

<p>Joel bared a brawny arm, and viewed it with
affection, then swung it out for her to see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>“And just think, it was only a week ago yesterday,
and you were picked up with a big cut
on your head, and we all thought you dead for
ever so long,” mourned Mrs. Benson.</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t dead; and is that any reason
for being mewed up forever, Mrs. Benson?”
asked Joel. “Nonsense! my old head is all
ready for another crack.”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” cried the little old lady,
stopping the wringing, to run around the foot
of the bed, and take Joel’s black curls in her
hands and kiss them over and over.</p>

<p>“Such good nursing as I’ve had, Mrs. Benson!”
exclaimed Joel, who liked immensely all
this petting. “Jim, you and I will long remember
this, won’t we, old fellow?”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” said Jim heartily.</p>

<p>“There!” said Joel, swinging himself up to his
full height at last, and marching across the room.
“I’m as good as new, made over, and patched up,
and warranted. Now, Jim, get me a barber, and
we’ll have all this mop off in double quick time.”
He shook back the black waves over his forehead.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” cried the little old lady in the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
distress, “don’t touch those beautiful curls!
I wouldn’t have one of ’em cut for anything.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe18_75" id="illus_p356">
<img class="w100" src="images/illus_p356.jpg" alt="“There!” said Joel, marching across the room">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“There!” said Joel, marching across the room. “I’m as good as
new, made over, and patched up, and warranted.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“They are the bane of my life,” cried Joel,
shaking them viciously. “You can’t think how
I just detest this poll of mine, Mrs. Benson.
Why that idiot of a doctor didn’t shave it all,
I don’t see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>“I wouldn’t let him, sir,” said Mrs. Benson.
“And he said the cut on the head wasn’t what
troubled him; you were exhausted with all you’d
done. It’s only a wonder that you pulled through
at all.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exploded Joel. “Well, now,
don’t you tell my family all this stuff when they
come.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell your family everything and
all there is to it,” declared little Mrs. Benson
obstinately. “I’m a-going to tell them, if ’twas
the last word I’d ever speak, how that precious
deary took care of the old woman, and got her
where she could be saved by you and Jim. And
they’re going to hear what <i>you</i> did, and that
nothing would have been of any earthly use if
it hadn’t been for you. They shall hear it, every
blessed word, sir. And after there wasn’t so much
as a rat left aboard, and you’d seen the captain and
Jim off, you jumped for your life, and was struck
by a floating spar. There, and there, and there!”
she cried.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Benson, dear Mrs. Benson,” began Joel.</p>

<p>“You won’t get me to say I won’t,” cried the
little old lady, “because I <i>will</i> tell them every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
single thing that you did, and what folks said,
and the whole. There again, sir.”</p>

<p>“Jim, get the barber!” roared Joel at him in
great dismay. So the barber, a thin, dapper little
man, soon appeared with all his paraphernalia;
and presently Joel’s black curls were sprawling
all over the floor, little Mrs. Benson on her
knees picking them up, and patting them, and
doing them up in a clean old handkerchief to
lay away in her lavender drawer with the rest of
her treasures.</p>

<p>And in the midst of it all, in walked Polly
and Jasper, Ben and David, while the three children
were here, there, and everywhere.</p>

<p>And on the morrow, the doctor being obliged
to say that Joel was perfectly able to go, having
recovered in a remarkable manner, all the party
bade good-by to little Mrs. Benson and “son
Henry” and his family, and off they hurried to
Rome; Jim being proud as possible—for wasn’t
he the Rev. Mr. Pepper’s body-servant, to remain
so, and go back home with them?</p>

<p>“I like that house,” said King, looking back
at the ironmonger’s red brick dwelling, on the
stoop of which was drawn up the little old lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
and her son the ironmonger and all his family,
“a great deal better than I do the hotel. I wish
I could have stayed over night there; it’s got lots
of things in the big front room I didn’t have a
chance to see.”</p>

<p>“And oh, they’re so good!” cried Polly, looking
back from the carriage with tears in her
eyes. “I can never forget, Joey dear, how good
they’ve been to you.”</p>

<p>“If it had not been for going there, I couldn’t
have made Phronsie and Grandpapa go and leave
me,” said Joel. “But dear me, Polly, that good
woman just nursed me up: you can’t think how
good she was to me,” cried Joel affectionately.</p>

<p>“I love her,” broke out Barby, and patting
Uncle Joel’s knee to attract his attention; “and
she’s my very own Mrs. Benson, she is; and when
I go again, I shall say, ‘How do you do, my very
own Mrs. Benson, and pretty well I thank you
mostly.’”</p>

<p>So in great glee they kept each other’s spirits
up along the way. But as they neared Rome,
Polly’s heart sank, and even Joel fidgeted about;
and Jasper and the “Pepper boys” had all they
could do to keep things bright and cheery. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
now and then had it been possible to hear from
Phronsie and the others, and then but scraps of
information: that Roslyn May was mending, although
the fever was not broken up; that Grandpapa
was keeping bravely all his anxiety and
distress to himself; and Mamsie wrote how beautiful
Phronsie was, till Joel had all he could do to
keep from crying outright. He thought he loved
Phronsie as much as he could before—they all
did; but since that night when they both faced
death, and, worse than anything that threatened
themselves, knew that it hung over dear Grandpapa,
Joel’s whole soul was bound up in Phronsie,
and it seemed to him as if he could never wait to
see her again. Over and over he beguiled the way
with the story of what Phronsie had said and
done on the ship all through that dreadful night,
till Polly and the boys and the children, hanging
on his words, knew it all by heart. And so on to
Rome. At last they were there.</p>

<p>Little Dr. Fisher, who had received their telegram,
met them. He looked worn and tired; but
he mastered a cheery smile for King and for Polly
and her babies, and he wrung Joel’s hand as only
he could wring it; and he said, “The fever hasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
left him, but he’s holding his own;” and that was
all they could get out of him. And then they all
hurried off to the hotel where Roslyn May lay
fighting for his young life, and Phronsie, Grandpapa,
and Mamsie were watching over him.</p>

<p>“Polly,” said Doctor Fisher desperately, and
getting a moment with her alone. “I must tell
you, I think the chances are slim unless”—</p>

<p>A little cry broke from Polly’s lips.</p>

<p>“Hush, Polly, my girl,” warned the little doctor
disapprovingly, regarding her over his big spectacles,
“why, that isn’t like you. It all depends
on our keeping our heads, you know.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it again, Papa Fisher,” said poor
Polly.</p>

<p>“Unless we can persuade Roslyn that Phronsie
and he are not to be separated again, I was going
to say,” went on Father Fisher calmly. “You see,
he has suffered off here alone by himself a long
time—I know, because he has told me all about
it; and then when he came back after Mr.
King,—I don’t blame your father,” the little
doctor made haste to say quickly, “but it was
pretty tough on Roslyn,—and then when he
came back to plunge into his work again after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
Mr. King’s send-off, why, he hadn’t much strength
to fall back on.”</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Polly eagerly.
“O papa-doctor! tell me, what can we do?”
and she clasped her hands. “I’ll do just anything,
if you’ll only tell me.”</p>

<p>The little doctor beamed on her. “Bless you,
Polly,” he said, “I depend on you to do it all.”</p>

<p>“All?” cried Polly, aghast.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dr. Fisher nodded briskly. “You see,—I
must be quick, for that scamp of a Joe is
listening with all his ears,—you see, Polly,
Roslyn May has got it into his head that as
soon as he is well, the old gentleman will spirit
Phronsie away again.”</p>

<p>“He shouldn’t,” began Polly indignantly,
“when Grandpapa has brought her clear over
here just to show that he has given up all
opposition.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, child!” said the little doctor; “you
can’t reason with a sick man. All I say is, that
Roslyn May has got it into his head that
Phronsie is to melt away in some sort of fashion
as soon as he gets well; and I can’t do
much for him—I really can’t, Polly, as long as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
that is in his mind.” He shook his head, and
looked so very dejected and miserable, that
Polly’s heart ached for him.</p>

<p>“O Father Fisher,” she cried, “this is very
dreadful! Oh, don’t look so!” seizing his hand;
“perhaps something will happen,” she added,
brightening up, “to make him believe that
Phronsie is to belong to him.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing,” said the little doctor;
and he put his mouth to Polly’s ear and
whispered something. “Oh, no, no!” cried Polly,
starting back, “it couldn’t ever be in all this
world, <i>here</i>!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Doctor Fisher set his spectacles
straight, and looked at her.</p>

<p>“Because—because, why, Phronsie should be
married at home, and have the biggest wedding,
Papa Fisher, you ever saw, and such a beautiful
one! Oh, no, no, no, no!” cried Polly, who
couldn’t stop herself, but felt as if she were
racing down hill, and all out of breath.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better than not to have <i>any</i>
wedding, Polly?” asked the little doctor slowly,
and looking at her with his small keen eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! yes, of course,” cried poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
Polly in horror, and feeling as if the whole
world were going awry just then. Not to have
a beautiful wedding, such as Phronsie ought to
have, just such an one as Polly had planned,
oh, so many times in her heart, for the pet of
the family! She drew away, and her eyes filled
with tears despite all her efforts.</p>

<p>Doctor Fisher paused a moment to give her
time to recover herself, and looked very grave.
“A big wedding isn’t the best of all blessings,”
he said; “and I don’t believe but what Phronsie
would prefer the quiet one—your mother
thinks so.”</p>

<p>“Does Mamsie think Phronsie better be married
here?” asked Polly, feeling as if everybody
were deserting her.</p>

<p>“She surely does, Polly,” said the little doctor.
“Well, I looked to you to influence Mr.
King—but say no more,” as the others crowded
around.</p>

<p>Mamsie! oh, when Polly found herself in the
dear arms, and felt the dear eyes upon her, she
seized Jasper’s hand. “O Jasper, we’ll never let
her go again,” she cried, “in all this world!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p365">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Oh, when Polly found herself in the dear arms, and felt the dear
eyes upon her.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But amidst the happiness of all being together
again, Polly carried around with her a heavy
heart. She knew that the little doctor was disappointed
in her; and somehow, when she saw
the dear Mamsie again, she felt that this disapproval
was shared by the one, whom, next to
Jasper, she loved the best in the world. And
in amongst all the delight with which the whole
bunch of Peppers revolved around Phronsie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
there was a little feeling of bitterness creeping
up in Polly’s heart, that Phronsie herself was
pining for something more that they must give
her.</p>

<p>Jasper found Polly so. “What is it, dear?”</p>

<p>“O Jasper! I’ve put it out of my head, but
it won’t stay out,” cried Polly. “Do you think
that Phronsie and Roslyn should be married
here?”</p>

<p>“I surely do, Polly,” said Jasper decidedly.</p>

<p>“What?” cried Polly, aghast, all her fine
visions of radiance on Phronsie’s wedding morn
tumbling at once. “Then, let us go to Mamsie,”
she said humbly, “and tell her we think so.
Don’t let us stop to talk about it, Jasper; but
we ought to go at once—this very minute.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.<br>

<small>EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON POLLY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“JASPER,” cried Polly, “do let us go to Mamsie;”
so hand in hand they hurried off to
Mrs. Fishers room. But she was not there.</p>

<p>“Oh! now I know that Roslyn is worse,”
mourned Polly, not to be comforted; “and they
would not tell me.” But Jasper said cheerfully,
“Oh, no, Polly! probably Father Fisher has taken
her out for an airing.”</p>

<p>“Jasper,” cried Polly in great remorse, “if I’d
only been willing”—she heaved a sigh even now
at the thought of what might have been Phronsie’s
marriage-day had all gone well, then she
put it resolutely down—“had I just been glad
to have her married here, perhaps he’d not been
worse—but now, oh, dear me!” and Polly broke
down, and sobbed on her husband’s shoulder like
a child.</p>

<p>He patted her head softly. “Polly, hush, dear;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
let us go around to Roslyn’s room, and see for
ourselves.”</p>

<p>So Polly mopped her face as best she could
with his handkerchief (she had forgotten her own),
and away they hurried to the sick-room. There,
sure enough, was Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>“Come in, Polly and Jasper,” she called, as she
glanced up, and saw them in the shadow of the
doorway.</p>

<p>Polly, with her heart bounding in relief, crept
in, hanging to Jasper’s hand.</p>

<p>Roslyn looked up from the pile of pillows
against which he leaned, and smiled a wan little
smile that lighted up his white face.</p>

<p>“Well, Polly,” he said, “and Jasper; so you
are not out this morning?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jasper, seeing that Polly was past
speaking; “but we shall drive to Pincian Hill this
afternoon,” he added cheerily. “Well, old man,”
going up to the couch that was drawn to the window,
and taking up one of the long, thin fingers,
“you’ll soon be running around with us, the best
one of all.”</p>

<p>Roslyn smiled wearily, as if the effort were
costing him much; then he shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>“Jasper,” he said slowly, “I will tell you
now,—as Phronsie is not in the room,—I shall
never be well. Something will happen to separate
us again.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, old fellow!” exclaimed Jasper, not
knowing what else to say, and taking refuge in
those words. “Why, Grandpapa is willing now,
you know, for you to marry Phronsie, else why
would he bring her? You’re blue, Roslyn; that’s
all.”</p>

<p>But Roslyn shook his head, and reiterated,
“Something will surely happen to separate us
again.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Polly was clutching Mother Fisher’s
gown. “O Mamsie!” she cried, “do come out of
here; I must talk to you.”</p>

<p>“‘Must’ will have to give way now, Polly,”
said Mrs. Fisher, quietly going on with her work
of preparing a gruel by a spirit-lamp over in a
corner; “for this ought to be done first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do forgive me, Mamsie!” cried Polly,
dreadfully ashamed of her abruptness; “I did
not notice what you were doing. But as soon
as ever you get through with that, do, will you,
please, then come where I can talk with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>Mother Fisher gave her a keen look. “Yes,
Polly,” she said, “I will, unless some other duty
comes in between.” So Polly was forced to wait
as patiently as possible until the gruel was done.
Meanwhile she clasped her hands tightly together,
while Jasper and Roslyn talked; afraid
all the while that she should show her increasing
dismay, as certain bits of the conversation fell
upon her ears.</p>

<p>At last the gruel was fed to Roslyn, his pillows
shaken up, and Dr. Fisher coming in, Mrs.
Fisher turned to Polly.</p>

<p>“Jasper,” said Polly, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>So the two followed Mother Fisher into a
smaller apartment that opened into the sick-room,
and Jasper closed the door softly; while
Polly threw herself down on the floor, and buried
her face in Mamsie’s lap in the old way.</p>

<p>“Now, what is it?” asked Mother Fisher,
smoothing Polly’s hair, as Jasper came and took
a chair next to the two.</p>

<p>“O Mamsie!” cried Polly brokenly, “I do want
Phronsie not to have the beautiful wedding at
home, but to be married here. And do forgive
me,” went on poor Polly, “for not wanting it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
before—it’s Jasper now who has shown me how
wrong I’ve been.”</p>

<p>“O Mamsie!” cried Jasper, who held Polly’s
hand in both of his; “indeed, she decided this
herself. This is all Polly’s own idea.”</p>

<p>“He said he thought Phronsie ought to be
allowed to have the wedding here, when I asked
him,” said Polly; “then I knew at once how
selfish I’d been.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say selfish, Polly,” begged Jasper.</p>

<p>“Polly,” said Mother Fisher, and her face
lightened, “I do think you have saved Phronsie
from terrible sorrow; for if you can persuade
Mr. King to let her be married here,—and no
other person can do it I’m very sure, as Phronsie
won’t speak,—you’ll see Roslyn well again.
And nothing else will bring him up, the doctor
and I both think.”</p>

<p>“I persuade Father King!” exclaimed Polly,
raising her head in dismay to look first at Mother
Fisher and then at Jasper. “Oh, I never could
in all this world!”</p>

<p>“I imagine you could for Phronsie,” said Mrs.
Fisher slowly.</p>

<p>“But he has just brought her clear over here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
at a dreadful sacrifice to his feelings,” went on
Polly in greater dismay; “and then to be teased
and urged to let her be married, and in a plain
little way, here—oh, I can’t do it!”</p>

<p>“‘Can’t’ is a word that you ought not to spell,
Polly,” said Mother Fisher gravely.</p>

<p>Polly shivered, and shrank down again into
Mamsie’s lap. “Oh! I know you’ve been disappointed
in me, Mamsie,” she cried, “because I
didn’t want Phronsie to lose the beautiful marriage-day
we all want to give her at home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Fisher slowly, “I was disappointed,
Polly.”</p>

<p>“But Polly has come to see it all right now,”
cried Jasper eagerly, and pressing Polly’s hand
comfortingly.</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” said Mrs. Fisher, still
smoothing Polly’s bright brown hair.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” said Polly at last, with a gasp, and
getting up to her feet. Jasper put his arm around
her, his eyes saying, “I wish I could help you,
Polly.”</p>

<p>“Polly better do it alone,” said Mother Fisher,
“and at once; for Mr. King is in his room
reading.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>So Polly, feeling scarcely less miserable than
she was before, since now she must inflict a great
blow on dear Grandpapa, went slowly out into the
hall, and on her errand.</p>

<p>Old Mr. King, as usual, was in a terrible state
over the newspapers. A little pile of them lay
before him on the table waiting to be scanned,
while he fumed and fretted over the one he held
in his hand. Polly felt, as she obeyed his “Come
in” to the timid rap she bestowed on his door, as
if the worst time in all the day were chosen to
proffer such a dreadful request. And for a moment
her heart stood still, and she did not attempt
to enter.</p>

<p>“Come in,” commanded the old gentleman in
such a dreadful roar that Polly trembled in every
limb, while he marched across the long apartment
and threw the door wide open. “Why in the
name of all that’s sensible, don’t you—oh, my
goodness me, Polly child!” and he drew her in.</p>

<p>He trembled inwardly as much as she, but with
difficulty controlled himself to lead her to a seat.
“Now, then, Polly, my child, what is the matter?
Tell your old daddy.” Then, his fears getting the
better of him, he broke out,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>“You’ve brought bad news. Roslyn is worse;”
and started for the door.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa—father dear,” cried Polly, flying
after him.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t that! It’s—it’s—I’ve come—to—to
ask you—”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="illus_p374">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Old Mr. King stood in front of Polly waiting for her to proceed.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old gentleman led her back to her seat with
a puzzled air, and stood in front of her waiting for
her to proceed; then, seeing that she made no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
headway, he exclaimed in displeasure, “Why,
Polly, am I so very dreadful that you cannot
come to make a simple request of me without
all this fear?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it isn’t a simple request, dear Grandpapa,”
said Polly, clasping her fingers nervously
as she realized that all this was only making
matters much worse for Phronsie and for Roslyn;
yet for her life she could get no farther than
“it’s—it’s”—</p>

<p>Old Mr. King took a turn or two down the
apartment, then came back to her with such a
displeased countenance as she had never seen him
wear before; at sight of which Polly forgot all
the attempts at a proper introduction to her plea,
and crying out, “O father, dear! do let Phronsie
and Roslyn be married here; for Dr. Fisher thinks
he won’t get well unless you do,” she threw herself
into his arms, and sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>“Is that all!” exclaimed Mr. King, patting her
brown hair.</p>

<p>“All!” cried Polly, taking up her head suddenly
to look at him; “all, Grandpapa! <i>Are</i> you
willing?” she gasped.</p>

<p>The old gentleman smiled down at her. “Child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
I’m not only willing, I’m glad,” he said. “Did
you think I’d no more sense, Polly, than to make
my little girl any further trouble? They shall be
married to-morrow if they want to be. Now send
Phronsie here to me, just as quickly as you can
fly for her,” he commanded, in such a merry tone
that Polly laughed in glee. Seeing which, as it
was what he had aimed at, he got so very cheery
as he escorted her to the door and saw her down
the hall, that she ran off on light feet. “Tell
her to hurry,” called old Mr. King as a last word
before she disappeared.</p>

<p>“Why, man alive!” said little Dr. Fisher, left
alone with his patient, “I tell you, you are in
a fair way to recovery, if you only think so.” He
set his big spectacles straight on his nose, and
glared at the white face on the pile of pillows
in what he meant to be a reassuring way.</p>

<p>Roslyn May shook his head, and clasped his
long, thin fingers together.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Dr. Fisher, as he felt
something coming in his eyes that caused him to
pull out his big handkerchief, and blow his nose
violently. “You are the last man I should expect
to preach pluck to. You’ve had a double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
allowance of backbone all your life, I take it,”
he added with a short laugh.</p>

<p>“I used to think that I was the possessor of
one,” said Roslyn, weakly smiling.</p>

<p>“Land alive!” cried the little man, delighted
at the smile, and getting cheerier than ever.
“You’ve set us all an example in grit and endurance.
Now, don’t be like a cow that gives a
good pail of milk and then kicks it all over,”
and he laughed again. “That’s New England
advice; you know I was raised on a farm,” he
added.</p>

<p>“I’ve had my death-blow in this fever,” said
Roslyn, the smile dying all out, and turning his
face on the pillow. “We shall only be separated
again; for Mr. King will never”—</p>

<p>The little doctor sprang to his side. He had
fainted. And in the next few days, when the
fever came back again, each one looked into the
other’s face with despair. All except Phronsie
herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can<i>not</i> endure it!” It was Charlotte
Chatterton who said this. Charlotte, who had
just come, walking in suddenly, with no word of
greeting, or expecting any. She just went up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
Mother Fisher, and put her two hands into the
firm ones extended.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Mother Fisher through white
lips. “You will say something you will be sorry
for afterward, maybe, Charlotte.”</p>

<p>Charlotte bit her lip. “Let me help; give me
something to do,” she begged. “No, I don’t
want to go to Phronsie yet; it would kill me to
see her suffer. I can<i>not</i> bear it, dear Mrs. Fisher.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte, could you leave your lessons?”
asked Mother Fisher suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Charlotte, “it was no use for me
to stay away; I got so nervous I couldn’t sing;
and even Herr Mericke said I best take a little
time off, and come and see for myself how you
were getting on. And then Ben’s last letter told
me that things were worse than you had reported.
And so here I am;” and she drew a long sigh.</p>

<p>“Charlotte, you don’t know how I have wanted
you,” said Mrs. Fisher, drawing her to her side.</p>

<p>“Have you?” cried Charlotte delightedly. “Oh!
if I had only known how badly things were going,
I should have dropped everything and come before.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely the reason,” said Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
Fisher, “why I wouldn’t let you be told, Charlotte.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Charlotte?” asked Phronsie, hearing
some one call her name in Mamsie’s room.</p>

<p>“You needn’t see her, dear; Charlotte will
wait. Do, Phronsie, try and get some rest,” said
Polly.</p>

<p>Phronsie, in her soft white wrapper on the sofa,
got up and went to the door. “Is she in Mamsie’s
room?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll call her,” said Polly, “if you’ll only let
me tuck you up on the sofa again, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will, Polly,” said Phronsie, obediently
going back, “if you will only call Charlotte in.”</p>

<p>So Polly tucked her up, and then ran into
Mother Fisher’s room. “Charlotte, you’re to
come,” she said, picking her by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t!” cried Charlotte, edging off toward
Mother Fisher.</p>

<p>“But you must,” said Polly imperatively, “for
Phronsie has sent for you.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte,” said Mrs. Fisher, with a smile at
the tall girl, “I’ll trust you.”</p>

<p>So Charlotte went off, with her heart warmed,
into Phronsie’s room; and Polly left them together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
and ran away to comfort old Mr. King, who nowadays
would hardly let her out of his sight.</p>

<p>“O Charlotte, how good of you to come!”
cried Phronsie, putting up her lips to be kissed,
as Charlotte went unsteadily over to the sofa.</p>

<p>Charlotte kneeled down by the sofa, and got
tight hold of Phronsie’s hands, mumbling something,
she couldn’t have told what, determined
she wouldn’t break down.</p>

<p>“Charlotte,” said Phronsie very earnestly, “you
are not to feel badly for me, because I almost
know that Roslyn will get well. I almost know
it, Charlotte.”</p>

<p>Charlotte gave a deep groan, and slid down to
the floor, where she sat, hanging to Phronsie’s
hands.</p>

<p>“God has kept him for me,” Phronsie went on;
“and he has brought us through just everything,
Charlotte, and he is going to let Roslyn get well,
I know. And now I want you to help to make
the others feel so too. Will you, Charlotte?”</p>

<p>But Charlotte couldn’t speak. So Phronsie
said, “I am so glad you have come, Charlotte;
for you can help Mamsie to see it—that Roslyn
will get well. Poor Mamsie is so tired too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>Charlotte buried her face in Phronsie’s soft
wrapper, and her shoulders shook with her efforts
not to say anything that she “was to be sorry for
afterward.”</p>

<p>“And Polly is worrying,” said Phronsie as a
matter of deep confidence, and a troubled look
came over her face. “O Charlotte! if you can
only help Polly not to worry, it will be just beautiful
in you. Will you, Charlotte?”</p>

<p>Again Charlotte could not speak. “Charlotte,”
said Phronsie gently, “I wish you would let me
see your face.”</p>

<p>Charlotte brought her head up suddenly. Both
cheeks were very red, and her lips were pressed
tightly together.</p>

<p>“Charlotte!” exclaimed Phronsie with a sudden
fear; “are you sick?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Charlotte explosively; “but I am
afraid I shall say something I ought not. O
Phronsie, if I only <i>could</i> help you!”</p>

<p>“You can,” said Phronsie quietly. “And O
Charlotte! I am so glad you are not sick;” and she
gave a relieved sigh.</p>

<p>“I can’t be any help to anybody,” declared
Charlotte, “except to work. I can work, if there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
anything to do, Phronsie; but as for influencing
any one, or helping them to believe anything, I’m
good for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte,” said Phronsie affectionately, “you
help me ever and ever so much. And so you do
help every one of us. And I will tell you what
you can do for me now. Will you sing to me,
Charlotte, just those soft little things you used to,
and hold my hand; and I shall go to sleep.”</p>

<p>So Charlotte grasped the edge of the sofa
tightly with one hand while Phronsie held the
other; and sitting there on the floor, she sang over
and over the things that she knew Phronsie
wanted.</p>

<p>“Charlotte is singing to Phronsie,” cried David,
rushing into Grandpapa’s room, where Polly and
Jasper sat with old Mr. King. “Mamsie said I
was to tell you, Polly, so you needn’t worry, for
now she will go to sleep.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>

<small>DESTRUCTION THREATENS THE LITTLE BROWN
HOUSE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“NOW,” said Mr. Tisbett, “see here, young
man, ef you’re a-goin’ to ride along with
me, you’ve jest got to set still. My senses, that
ma of yourn would give me fits ef anythin’ was
to happen to you; though why she should, I
don’t see.”</p>

<p>“Let me have the whip,” cried Johnny, wriggling
for the possession of that article.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” declared Mr. Tisbett. “Whoa,
there!” this to his horses. “Now, that Mis’
Lambert wants to go to th’ deepo, I’ll be bound,”
pulling up to a big white house a little back
from the road. “Yis’m,” as a handkerchief
waved frantically out of one of the small-paned
windows.</p>

<p>“I want to go to Hubbardville, Mr. Tisbett,”
said the woman who held it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>“Well, if you’re a-goin’ to Hubbardville,” observed
the stage-driver, whipping out a big silver
watch, “I take it you better be steppin’ lively,
Mis’ Lambert. I’m on my way to th’ deepo
now, an’ I don’t come back this way.”</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” exclaimed Mrs. Lambert, darting
away from the window; and in a minute or two
she came out, catching her paisley shawl by its
two ends to tuck them under her arm, while she
endeavored to pin her bonnet-strings.</p>

<p>“Susan,” she called over her shoulder to some
one in the entry, “I’ve forgot my bag.” Then
she took out one of the pins which she had
hastily put into her mouth for just such emergencies,
and pinned up the long ribbons that
might be said to have seen better days.</p>

<p>“I wish folks would be ready when they hail
th’ stage,” observed Mr. Tisbett to Johnny, not
careful in the least to lower his voice from his
ordinary tone. Then he roared out, “Come, Mis’
Lambert, I shall have to go without you.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming!” said Mrs. Lambert quickly.</p>

<p>“Your bonnet ain’t on straight, ma,” said
Susan, coming with the bag to the doorstone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lambert put up both hands, and twitched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
it the wrong way, thereby letting the paisley
shawl slip to the ground.</p>

<p>“That’s worse than ’twas before!” exclaimed
Susan, giving the bonnet a pull that carried up
one set of her mother’s puffs as neatly as if she
had been scalped, and sent a side-comb flying to
the ground.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mrs. Lambert, putting out
her hand for the comb, and beginning to look
around for the shawl. “There, fling it on my
arm; I c’n put it on in th’ stage.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tisbett rattling his whip against the dashboard,
she stepped off the stone at the same
minute that Susan twitched the puff into place.
“You tell your pa he’ll find his clean shirt an’
stock on th’ bedroom bureau,” she called, looking
back, “this aft’noon.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Susan.</p>

<p>“An’ don’t forgit th’ meat bilin’ in th’ pot.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Susan.</p>

<p>“Air you goin’ to git in?” asked Mr. Tisbett
sarcastically, by this time holding the stage-door
open, “or air ye goin’ to hold conversations only?
Please let me know, ma’am, for I’m goin’ to start
this ere stage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>Here was Johnny’s opportunity. He seized the
whip, and brought it smartly down on the off
horse, with the result that Mr. Tisbett was laid
flat on his back on the roadside,—round went
the wheels, up flew the horses’ heels, and, in a
cloud of dust, Johnny was driving down the
turnpike.</p>

<p>“Th’ stage is goin’!” exclaimed Mrs. Lambert,
starting in dismay, and huddling up her bag
and shawl in a small heap together on her arm;
“now I sha’n’t get to Hubbardville. Oh, be you
hurt?” as Mr. Tisbett picked himself up, and
plunged down the road after his vehicle.</p>

<p>He roared to some farmers at work in a field
to help in the chase, pointing frantically to the
lumbering stage ahead; but they had already
stared at it, and now stopped to listen to him
without stirring a muscle, as he dashed on. The
only thing he could think of by way of possible
comfort, was that the horses, through force of
habit, might take it into their heads to go straight
to the depot, which proved to be the case; Johnny
being so paralyzed with the grandeur of driving,
that he held the reins steadily all the way.</p>

<p>The only passenger in the stage, a woman with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
a big bandbox, got out more dead than alive, as
the horses swung up to the little station; and
the men collected there waiting for the train
to come, wrenched Johnny, notwithstanding his
howls, from his seat and down to the platform.</p>

<p>“Who is that boy?” demanded the passenger
when she could get her breath.</p>

<p>“He b’longs to Mrs. Fargo, one o’ th’ rich folks
that’s stayin’ here this summer,” said one man,
rolling his quid over to the other cheek.</p>

<p>“Rich, is he?” the woman set down her bandbox,
and advanced to Johnny. “Well, I’m goin’
to shake that boy, ’cause I know his folks won’t;
an’ I want to see it done.” And before any one
could put up a hand, she seized Johnny’s sailor-collar,
and shook him smartly. Then she picked
up her bandbox, patted out her dress in satisfaction,
and sat down to wait for the train.</p>

<p>Mr. Tisbett, running along quite blown, came
up just then, as Johnny ran to the woman.</p>

<p>“You shook me,” said Johnny, with blazing
cheeks.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said the woman grimly; “an’ if
I had time before the train comes, an’ wasn’t so
beat out with th’ shock, I’d do it again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>Johnny clinched his small hands, and beat the
air fruitlessly. “I’ll tell Mr. King,” he howled.</p>

<p>“Hey? What’s that you say?” cried the
woman.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Mr. King,” screamed Johnny, quite
red in the face.</p>

<p>“What’s that boy got to do with the Kings?”
said the woman to Mr. Tisbett; “hurry up and
tell me, ’cause the train’s comin’. Mercy! I
wouldn’t ’a’ shook anybody they know, for nothin’.”</p>

<p>But there was no time to explain; and she was
helped on the train, with her bandbox, saying the
last thing, “I wouldn’t have shook him for nothin’,
if I’d known”—</p>

<p>There was only one passenger for Mr. Tisbett’s
stage,—an old colored woman with a big-figured
lace veil over her face and a variety of bundles.
The stage-driver settled her and her belongings
within the vehicle, then he turned off for Johnny.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir-ee!” dragging him along by his big
collar; “you’re goin’ to set inside, after that
’xploit. Now, marm,” as they reached the stage,
“will you have the goodness to keep an eye on
that boy,” hoisting Johnny in; “an’ where do you
want to stop?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>“To Mr. Jasper King’s,” answered the woman.
“Land! but ef here ain’t Johnny Fargo! I done
am s’prised”—</p>

<p>“O Candace!” screamed Johnny, tumbling all
over her, “did you bring some red-and-white
drops?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Candace, “I did; but they’s fer”—</p>

<p>“Look out for him!” screamed Mr. Tisbett,
clapping to the door to fly to his seat. Then he
gave the horses their heads, and presently swung
up to “The Oaks” in his usual fine style; for
nothing but the best flourish would satisfy him
there.</p>

<p>Candace got out of the stage as leisurely as she
could, with Johnny hauling at her, and insisting
that he must carry all the bundles; and Mr. Tisbett
drove off toward Hubbardville.</p>

<p>The big mansion was very still as Candace waddled
up the carriage-drive, with Johnny spilling
portions of his armful as he went along, and
then hurrying back to pick them up. “Land!”
exclaimed Candace, toiling on, “if I ain’t glad to
get here to see my bressed folks an’ s’prise dem.
I hain’t slept a week o’ nights sence dey done
lef dere ole home. Whew! Ise all out o’ bref.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>“We don’t want to buy anything,” said one of
the maids coming out to the side porch, and
looking at the big bag on the old colored woman’s
arm, Johnny being back of the evergreens around
one of the curves, picking up the last article
dropped.</p>

<p>“Who’s asked yer to buy anyting?” demanded
Candace in scorn, and seating herself on one of
the steps, utterly unable to go farther. “Yer
speak to Mrs. Jasper King as quick as you kin,
or to him.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Jasper King isn’t home. They aren’t any
of them home; they’ve gone abroad,” said the
maid.</p>

<p>“Whar’s abroad?” screamed Candace, letting
her bag roll out of her hands to the ground.</p>

<p>“Oh! over to England; and then they were
going to Rome,” said the maid coolly.</p>

<p>“O my bressed chilluns!” mourned Candace,
swinging her heavy body back and forth on the
step, while she wrung her black hands. Johnny
staggered up with all the parcels.</p>

<p>“It’s Candace,” screamed Johnny. “Hannah,
don’t you know, she lives where I do when I’m
home, and where Mr. King used to live before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
he came here. Now will you give me some red-and-white
drops?” He deposited all the bundles
on the floor of the porch, and hugged up to the
big black figure.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“‘O my bressed chilluns!’ mourned Candace.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Hannah ran to call Mrs. Higby, who sent her
for Mrs. Fargo; but she had gone over to Grandma
Bascom’s, it being her morning for that duty,
so the maid hurried down the lane to the little
cottage. “O Mrs. Fargo!” she exclaimed, hurriedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
entering. “Oh! where is she?” as the old
lady sat up against her pillows, the only occupant
of the room.</p>

<p>“Hey?” said Grandma.</p>

<p>“Where is Mrs. Fargo?” called Hannah excitedly.</p>

<p>“I can’t hear what you say,” replied old Mrs.
Bascom, putting one hand behind her ear.</p>

<p>“I say I want to know where”—</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want anythin’,” said Grandma,
dropping her hand, and settling back into a good
position again. “I’m pretty comf’able this morning,
Hannah.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where Mrs. Fargo went to?”
cried Hannah in a loud, excited key, and running
everything together. “When did she leave here?”</p>

<p>“Hey?” cried Grandma.</p>

<p>So Hannah had to shout it all over again, till
she was quite exhausted; then she began to content
herself with one word, “Fargo,” which she
said over and over.</p>

<p>“She’s just gone,” at last said old Mrs. Bascom.</p>

<p>“Where?” cried the maid, her mouth close to
the old lady’s cap-frills.</p>

<p>“Down to th’ village to get me some med’cine,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
said Grandma. So Hannah flew out and
over home, and Mrs. Higby sent one of the men
in a pony-cart for Mrs. Fargo. By this time Candace
was in a truly dreadful state with longing to
see the face of this old friend. As that lady
used to go with members of the King household
to the little shop on Temple Place, the poor
old black woman thought if she could only catch
a sight of Mrs. Fargo, she would somehow get
nearer to her “bressed chilluns.”</p>

<p>“How she does act, doesn’t she, Mrs. Higby?”
cried Johnny, who now gave up all thoughts of
the red-and-white drops, and crowding up to compass
as much of this new excitement as possible.</p>

<p>“Hum! I don’t know as she’s any worse actin’
than some other folks not a thousand miles
away,” said Mrs. Higby. “Well, I wish to goodness
your ma would come;” and she hurried to
crane her neck out of the window. “Now, thank
fortune,” she cried joyfully, “here she is! Now,
Johnny, you run off an’ play, that’s a good
boy,” as Mrs. Fargo hurried in.</p>

<p>Johnny, thus dismissed, ran down the terraces,
and over in the direction of the little brown house.
He was never allowed to go in it without a maid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
but this morning he determined to peep in one of
the windows, “Just to see if everything’s there,”
he said; and then, after that performance was over
to his satisfaction, he began to play that he was
really going in, and that he lived there, just as
the little Peppers had told about so many times.
And then he tried every door; and at last, to his
astonishment, found the one in the “Provision
Room” unlocked, as a careless maid who had been
cleaning there that very morning, under Mrs.
Higby’s direction, had left it.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” cried Johnny gleefully, racing
in; “now I’m a little Pepper. I’m Joel—no, I
don’t want to be Joel. I’m David—no, I don’t
want to be David, either. I’ll be Ben—I’ll be
Ben and Joel and David and all of ’em,” he
declared, hurrying around. “Now, what shall I
play first? I’ll—I’ll”—</p>

<p>His eyes fell on the stove. “I’m going to have
a baking-day all to myself!” he cried in joyful
tones, and capering in the middle of the kitchen.
“Oh, won’t that be fine! And when they see
what splendid cakes I can bake, they won’t care.
Phooh! I can make better things than any of ’em,
I b’lieve. And I know how to make the fire too.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
He was now so busy that the old kitchen presented
the appearance of being the scene of the
most active operations of a dozen small boys, as
he brought flour, trailing it all over the neat floor,
and sugar and molasses from the buttery, leaving
a chain of sticky drops everywhere he stepped, to
run and get the rolling-pin and handsful of dishes.</p>

<p>“I better make my fire first,” he said in the
midst of this, and dropping everything where he
stood. “Now I must get the paper and the
wood;” and he scuttled off to the “Provision
Room” to bring them in. Then, stuffing them
into the stove as tightly as he could cram them,
Johnny backed off, and surveyed his work in great
pride.</p>

<p>“Now, I know where the matches are kept,” he
cried in a jubilant voice—“in the little blue dish
on the shelf;” so pulling up a chair, he soon had
them in his hand, and drawing one as he ran back,
he had a merry little light that made him crow
gleefully.</p>

<p>“There, now, sir-ee!” he cried, holding this to
a bunch of paper that stuck up one end out of the
stove; “you’ll burn, I guess, when <i>I</i> get hold of
you. Yes, sir-ee!” but the fire running down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
match-end and nipping his fingers, he twitched
them off, to wipe them hastily on his blouse;
what there was left of the match tumbling down
back of him, in a small heap of paper and shavings
that wouldn’t go into the stove.</p>

<p>Johnny rubbed his hands together joyfully, and
hopped up and down before the stove. “Oh,
what cakes I will bake!” he cried. “And perhaps
I’ll put white on top of some of ’em; I
haven’t decided yet. And I’ll make a gingerbread
boy—I’ll make a dozen gingerbread boys—I’ll—”</p>

<p>Just here his little legs felt warm; and he
backed off from the stove and whirled around to
cool off a bit, to see the heap of papers and
shavings on the floor, in the merriest little blaze
imaginable, while one small tongue of flame
reached out and licked his blouse.</p>

<p>Johnny gave one scream and rushed out; the
little tongue of flame persisting in staying on his
blouse, while the other little flames left behind in
the old kitchen, every second growing big and
strong, were having a jolly time of it.</p>

<p>“<i>Fire!</i>” screamed Johnny, leaving wide the
“Provision Room” door as he bounded off across
the lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397-398]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>“Hillo!” cried Patsy, who came around the
palings to look at him, but not hearing what he
said as he rushed madly off for the terraces.
“Oh, murther—murther!”</p>

<p>He cleared everything between Johnny and
himself by one or two bounds, and soon had him
rolling over and over on the grass. “Now, to
make <i>absolutely</i> sure,” said Patsy at last, “I’m
going to turn the hose on ye. Been building a
bonfire somewheres, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“There’s more of it in there,” said Johnny, and
finding his voice to point a shaking finger in the
direction of the little brown house.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“There.”</p>

<p>No need to ask now. Smoke was coming out
of the little brown house “Provision Room” door.
Patsy yelled “<i>Fire!</i>” as loud as he could scream,
and dashed down to it. In less time than it takes
to tell it, every man on the place was busy, working
with a will to save the little brown house.
The big mansion was deserted of all. Even Candace
forgot her misery and desolation, to waddle
as fast as she could to the scene, wringing her
hands and crying as she went.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII.<br>

<small>PHRONSIE’S MARRIAGE BELLS!</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OH, the dear, precious little brown house!</p>

<p>How they worked—every man, woman,
and child on the place—to save it! There was
no time for the fire-department down in the
village to get there, although the private alarm
from “The Oaks” was sounded. What was to
be done, must be done quickly; and everybody
took hold and did the thing that seemed nearest
and best.</p>

<p>Mrs. Higby passed pails of water as rapidly
as if her hands and feet were young; preferring
the old-fashioned ways of putting out a fire
to the long lines of hose that the stable-men
soon had in and around the little brown house.
Candace, who immediately found that when she
could work for her “bressed folks” she wasn’t
lonely, waddled in and out, carrying everything
she could lay her hands on, out to the grass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
in safety, despite the fact that she was invited
several times by the workers who didn’t know
her, to “get out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Git out ob de way, you’d tell me, pore w’ite
trash, you!” Candace would mutter to herself
at such times, smothering her wrath as best she
could till she was sure the little brown house
was safe; then she would teach these servants,
one and all, that she was “a relict,” and had
lived with Mr. King’s folks long before they
were born. “Tink dey kin teach <i>me</i>,” fumed
Candace under her turban, waddling on fiercely.</p>

<p>And after the last vestige of the dreadful
flame was out, and the smoke cleared away, it
was found that nothing was burned that would
bring sorrow to one of the “Five Little Peppers.”</p>

<p>Mamsie’s rocking-chair, in which she used to
sit in the old days, sewing the coats and sacks
to keep the wolf from the door, was carried out,
the little old cushion blazing at one end; but
quick hands had beaten out the fire, so this was
saved. And though the fire had run along
the trail of shavings and paper dropped from
Johnny’s armful, as he carried it in from the
“Provision Room,” strange to say, beyond making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
dreadful black marks on the old kitchen
floor to show its progress, and the scorching of
the cupboard door, no damage was done. And
then everybody drew a long breath, and stopped
working, to gaze into each other’s faces; for the
little brown house was safe!</p>

<p>And just then up clattered the village fire-department,
and right back of them appeared
Alexia, who, coming out of the post-office to drive
to “The Oaks,” when told the news, made her
pony run at top speed, so that she reached the
scene almost at the same moment.</p>

<p>Patsy, who always ran to Mrs. Dodge’s aid,
saw her first, and tore across the lawn, to catch
the reins as she flung them to him.</p>

<p>“Is it the little brown house?” gasped Alexia,
not daring to look in that direction, as she jumped
out.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“Is it gone? all gone?” she screamed. Then
she sat right down on the bank, and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am!” cried Patsy; “sure it’s not.”</p>

<p>“Not out? Oh, dear, dear, dear!” cried Alexia,
waving back and forth in distress; “it will kill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
them all. We might as well all be dead as to
have the little brown house burnt up. Oh, dear—dear—dear!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="illus_p403">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“‘We might as well all be dead, as to have the little brown house
burnt up,’ said Alexia.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“It’s there!” cried Patsy, extending all the fingers
of one hand to point at it; “a-standing just
as nice and”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>Alexia sprang to her feet, and seized his arm.
“Patsy!” she cried, “do you mean to tell me that
if I turn around I shall see the little brown house
the same as ever?”</p>

<p>“Yis’m,” said Patsy; “if you opens your eyes
you will.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge whirled around and took one look;
then she sped on light feet over the terraces and
across the lawn.</p>

<p>“She rins like a birud would fly,” said Patsy,
watching her; “dishdainin’ the ground like”—then
he hopped into her cart, and drove it around
to the stables. “If ye could turn yere hose onto
that boy as did it, it ud be a blessing,” he said
to the firemen.</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word,” said Mrs. Higby, flushed
and anxious, “Johnny’s badly burned; and you
must run for Dr. Porter, Patsy.”</p>

<p>“Burned is he?” cried Patsy, and his face fell;
for Johnny was a great favorite of his, despite
his words; and he rushed off in Mrs. Dodge’s
pony-cart.</p>

<p>Alexia, after first satisfying herself by investigation
that the little brown house was really
safe, and that the precious things huddled out on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
the grass were not all burnt up, rushed off to find
some one who could tell her all about it. The
first person she ran against was Candace.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness me!” cried Alexia gustily;
“how did you get here, Candace?”</p>

<p>“It’s a mercy I did come,” said Candace, not
stopping to answer the question; “for I don’
know wot dey’d done widout me. Wy, <i>I</i> brung
out mos’ o’ dem tings,” sweeping her black arm
over toward the household treasures on the lawn.
“I brung de little cheer, an’ de”—</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Alexia. “Well, how <i>did</i> it
ever happen?”</p>

<p>“An’ I brung de tea-kettle an’ de plates an’”—</p>

<p>“Yes, well, never mind those now!” exclaimed
Alexia impatiently; “do tell me, how did it ever
happen?”</p>

<p>“Chile,” said Candace, “nebber min’ how it
done happen—de ting now is, who had sense
enough to ’tend to gettin’ out de tings. Wot
dey’d done ef I hadn’t a-come I d’no eber in all
dis worl’”—</p>

<p>“Hannah!” cried Mrs. Dodge in despair to the
maid hurrying by, “do you know? Tell me, how
came the little brown house to be on fire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>“Johnny Fargo went in and played making a
fire,” said Hannah.</p>

<p>“Johnny Fargo! Oh, the little scamp!” cried
Alexia; “now that boy ought to have a good
drubbing,” she cried, quite beside herself.</p>

<p>“There can’t anybody give it to him,” said
Hannah, hurrying on, “because he’s burnt, and
the doctor’s coming.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the pore leetle lamb!” exclaimed Candace,
raising her black hands; “now I must nuss him.
He was so good to bring up my passels, an’ to
wait on me in—well, well, I d’no know wot
dey’d have done ef I hadn’t ’a’ come;” and she
waddled off, Mrs. Dodge closely following, remorsefully
determining to do everything in the
world now for Johnny instead of the drubbing.</p>

<p>And so it turned out that the two letters in
her pocket she had just taken out of the post-office
when she heard of the fire, remained there
forgotten until the doctor had dressed Johnny’s
burns and gone, and she had Mrs. Fargo on the
sofa in Polly’s room, where they had fled for
refuge.</p>

<p>“There, now, you ought not to cry, you know,
Mrs. Fargo,” she said. “Oh, dear me! what would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
Polly Pepper say to you if she were here? I’m
good for nothing; but you really ought not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I cannot help it!” cried Mrs. Fargo, deep
in her handkerchief. “My poor little boy! and
then to think of that precious house—why, if
he’d set this one on fire, it wouldn’t have been
one-half as bad.”</p>

<p>“Well, it didn’t burn up,” cried Alexia, twitching
her sleeve, “so what’s the use of crying now.
Oh, dear me—why, here are the letters!” and she
tore them out of her pocket. “One for you, and
one for me—from Polly!” and in a minute she
was deep in hers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fargo, just commencing to read the heading
of her own letter, heard a funny little sound;
and glancing up, saw Alexia making every effort
to speak, her face working dreadfully. The letter
had fallen from her hands to the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh! what is it?” cried poor Mrs. Fargo, feeling
that this day must be bewitched, and dreading
she knew not what; and she jumped up, too
frightened now to cry, and ran to Polly’s toilet-table
for salts.</p>

<p>“Read—read—your letter!” gasped Alexia.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, if it’s bad news!” cried Mrs. Fargo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
shrinking and trembling. “Where are they—oh,
here!” She brought the bottle of salts, and held
it to Alexia’s nose.</p>

<p>“Phronsie Pepper is married!” cried Alexia,
twitching away her head.</p>

<p>“<i>Phronsie Pepper is married?</i>” repeated Mrs.
Fargo blankly.</p>

<p>“The very day that Polly wrote,” declared
Alexia tragically; then she made a dive for her
letter on the floor.</p>

<p>“Read it, Alexia,” begged Mrs. Fargo, “for I
can’t;” and she sank down on the sofa, and
wound her arms around Mrs. Dodge.</p>

<p>“And I’m sure I want to hold on to somebody
too,” declared Alexia. “Oh, dear me, Mrs. Fargo,
to think you and I won’t ever see Phronsie married!
Oh, dear, dear!” and the tears of vexation
sprang to her eyes. “And it will almost kill
Polly not to have the wedding here—and all the
hosts and hosts of friends Phronsie Pepper has,
and—what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything,” breathed Mrs. Fargo;
“it’s already done—do read it all,” she added
faintly.</p>

<p>So Alexia dashed ahead,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span></p>

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Hotel Costanzi, Rome</span>, <i>July, 18—</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Alexia</span>,—</p>

<p>“‘You are to be very glad to begin with, at the
piece of news I shall tell you right away. And
that is, that Phronsie was married this morning
to Roslyn May.’—</p>

<p>“Glad! Indeed I’m not!” cried Alexia; “to go
and steal such a march on you and me and all her
piles of friends, Mrs. Fargo—and <i>such</i> a wedding
as we’d have given her.”</p>

<p>“The precious dear,” murmured Mrs. Fargo.
“Go on, Alexia.”</p>

<p>Alexia sniffed off two or three disappointed
tears, and rushed on,—</p>

<p>“‘It was just this way. You see, Roslyn, poor
boy, got it into his head that Grandpapa would
separate them again, though of course that was
the fever, and because he had suffered so much
since he had last seen Phronsie; and although he
got better, and it seemed as if he were coming up
finely, he brooded so over that idea that Papa-Doctor
got quite in despair. And then Father
King’—</p>

<p>“Can’t you see Polly’s face when she is going
to tell something splendid about Mr. King,” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
Alexia, glancing down the page. “Oh, dear me!—where
was I,” going back again, “oh,—‘and
then Father King was just royal! He told
Phronsie that all he cared for was to make her
happy, and that nothing would make him so
happy as to have the marriage take place here;
and they were just going to tell Roslyn, when
Papa-Doctor sent them word that Roslyn was
worse. And then those were just dreadful days;
for the fever came back, and Phronsie smiled
when we looked troubled at her; but she was
just like a shadow—so thin and so white. O
Alexia, I can’t bear to think of those days!
Charlotte Chatterton came from Germany, and
she was such a comfort; but we all just clung
to each other in despair. Only Phronsie kept
saying she knew Roslyn would get well.’</p>

<p>“This is very dreadful,” sniffed Alexia, wiping
away the tears furtively. At last she just let
them rain down. “I’m a miserable, selfish little
pig,” she said, “not to be glad to have her married
there.”</p>

<p>“O poor Phronsie!” sighed Mrs. Fargo, “and
poor Polly, and all.”</p>

<p>“‘And—and’” went on Alexia recovering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
her place in her letter, “‘and one day when
everything seemed the blackest, and as if we
couldn’t bear it another minute longer, Roslyn
came up again. And then Grandpapa told him
how everything was to be as he wished. Well,
from that moment, Alexia, the world was bright
again, and the sun shone, and we all were as
glad as glad could be: and Roslyn just adores
Grandpapa. You can’t think how devoted they
are to each other. And so everything was quickly
arranged—for who do you think should drop
down suddenly but Roslyn’s father, General May!
Now, wasn’t that perfectly lovely! I always suspect
that Father King sent for him, though he
doesn’t say so.’</p>

<p>“Just think how all those people had Phronsie
to themselves,” mourned Alexia, who, now
that Roslyn was mending, returned to her own
grievances. “And Grace Tupper too—she was
at that wedding; and Pickering and you and I,
Mrs. Fargo, left out in the cold.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” sighed Mrs. Fargo; “well, go
on, Alexia.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! well, where was I? Oh—‘and
so this morning Phronsie and Roslyn were married.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
Roslyn was very weak; but he was lifted
out of his chair, and insisted on standing during
a part of the ceremony. And Joel married
them beautifully. And Grandpapa gave Phronsie
away.’</p>

<p>“Oh dear, dear!” screamed Alexia, quite carried
out of herself, “why <i>couldn’t</i> we have been
there!</p>

<p>“‘And Roslyn’s just as beautiful and splendid,
and he’s my brother now,’” Polly’s letter went on;
“‘and I’m so happy, Alexia, about it, you can’t
think. And Phronsie wore one of her white
muslin dresses, and carried the white prayer-book
that Roslyn gave her; and she was married with
his mother’s ring he had worn all these years.
And Roslyn looked like one of the pictures of the
young gods, he was so handsome; and Phronsie—well,
she was our Phronsie! Oh! and Roslyn’s
work, begun in his studio, is considered most remarkable.
He is surely, so we are told on all
sides, to be one of the foremost sculptors of
the age. And you can’t think how proud Grandpapa
is of him!’</p>

<p>“‘And now, you poor dear! I know how badly
you feel not to have Phronsie married at home.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>Alexia gave a deep groan, as if words were
beyond her.</p>

<p>“‘And that you couldn’t even see her married.
Well, now, Alexia, Phronsie wants me to tell you
a piece of news, a secret just yet, only for you
and Pickering and dear Mrs. Fargo to know.
Roslyn and she are to live in the little brown
house; and he is to build a studio in the meadow
back of it, and not go to Rome only once in a
while, when they want to travel. Did you ever
hear of anything so splendid!’”</p>

<p>Alexia squealed in delight; then her sallow
cheek turned quite white. “Mrs. Fargo,” and she
clutched that lady’s arm, “suppose, only suppose
for an instant, that it had burned down this
morning!</p>

<p>“‘And we are to give her and Roslyn the most
beautiful marriage reception. Oh, you can’t think
how beautiful it will all be at “The Oaks” when
they come home’—</p>

<p>“Oh!” squealed Alexia, again seizing Mrs. Fargo
by the arm; “now, you and I will have our
good time, won’t we, for being cheated out of all
the rest? It’s too splendid for anything! Mrs.
Fargo, I never thought of the welcome-home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
party we could give them! Why, that will be
almost as good as having Phronsie married here;”
and she jumped off the sofa, and began to pirouette
around the room. “But how can we ever
plan it with Polly away?” and she came to a
sudden stop, her brow wrinkling in perplexity.</p>

<p>“You better finish your letter,” advised Mrs.
Fargo. “Polly probably has something to say on
that point. Then you can jump, Alexia, all you
want to.”</p>

<p>So Alexia flew back to her letter. “Where was
I? Oh—at ‘“The Oaks” when they come home.
We are coming first, Jasper and I, with the children
and Grace, who has been the dearest little
comfort in all this world. Joel and David, of
course, must get back as soon as possible, so they
are coming with us. Ben will stay with Mamsie
and Dr. Fisher, and Grandpapa and Phronsie and
Roslyn, a few weeks longer; and then they will
all come home together, and bring Charlotte Chatterton
with them.’</p>

<p>“Oh, goody, goody!” exclaimed Alexia, beating
her palms together in joy. “And I’ll venture
to say that then you’ll see I’m right, my dear
Mrs. Fargo, about Charlotte Chatterton and Ben.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>“Maybe so,” said Mrs. Fargo wisely. “Well, is
that all?”</p>

<p>“Um—um—let me see,” said Alexia, whirling
the letter again; “yes, except—‘I have written
a letter with all these details to dear Mrs. Fargo—and
I know you go to see dear Grandma Bascom
every day, Alexia; and do tell her all this
that I have told you, and that, please God, we
shall be home, the first party of us, very soon
now. And then, dear, won’t you and I plan for
Phronsie’s home-coming!’</p>

<p>“Won’t we, though!” cried Alexia with shining
eyes. “Well,” drawing a long breath, “I must
hurry off and tell Grandma Bascom all the news;
and then, says I, I must let that blessed baby
know all about it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>

<small>HOME TO THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">POLLY and Jasper and the children were home
once more, and everything was back in the old
ways, with Joel in his parish, and David in his
instructor’s chair at the college. And now an
intense excitement filled all the minds of the
“Peppers” and their friends over the approaching
“Welcome-Home” they were to give Phronsie.</p>

<p>“It shall be just as splendid as the wedding
would have been!” declared Alexia positively.
“Just as bride-y and stunning as it can possibly
be!” she would cry, on one of her rushing-in-and-out
visits to “The Oaks.”</p>

<p>“Do tell me, <i>are</i> the Dunraven Home children
surely to be here?” she asked one day, bursting
into Polly’s room, to find her surrounded by
a cloud of white muslin, and clashing her scissors
in and out of little skirt breadths. “Oh, my goodness
me! what <i>are</i> you doing, Polly Pepper?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>“Yes,” cried Polly happily, and sending her
scissors down another breadth; “and these are
their dresses, Alexia. Don’t you want to get
another pair of scissors, and help cut off the
skirts? Miss Bangs down in the village is going
to make them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” cried Alexia, plunging over to
Polly’s neat work-basket. “Oh, dear!” as she
rummaged it; “I can’t find another pair, Polly!”</p>

<p>“In the sewing-room,” said Polly, fluttering
the cloud busily, to measure another breadth.</p>

<p>“I’ll set that basket to rights when I come
back, for I’ve messed it up dreadfully,” cried
Alexia, flying off, to return with a pair which she
brandished high. “Oh, dear me, Polly Pepper,
will you ever in this world get through with all
you’ve on your hands, I wonder! How many
Dunraven youngsters are coming?”</p>

<p>“Twenty,” said Polly, her head on one side,
calculating; “that is, Mrs. Henderson thinks that
it is safe to plan to bring as many. And Susan
is really to sing a Welcome-Home song, as they
march around Phronsie and Roslyn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how perfectly sweet!” breathed Alexia,
already deep in the cutting-off process. “Dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
me, how do you keep yours straight? Mine all
skews up.”</p>

<p>“You better draw a thread, then,” advised
Polly; “unless you can follow your eye.”</p>

<p>“My eye is as crooked as can be,” declared
Alexia; “I’m in such a twitter. Well, isn’t it
just too lovely that Susan is really to sing.
Phronsie will be delighted. Dear me, don’t you
remember how Susan roared that first day she
came, and how she looked—little black image, I
can see her now, sitting up there on a cricket on
the platform. I was frightened to death, and expected
she’d break the whole thing up; and now
how good she is, and quite the pride of Phronsie’s
heart.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it will be a perfect surprise, I think,”
hummed Polly ecstatically. “Oh! and the village
children are going to be at the station when the
trains gets in, with baskets of flowers, and throw
blossoms in Phronsie’s path.”</p>

<p>“Are they?” cried Alexia in delight; “oh,
my!”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ve begged to,” said Polly; “and we
are going to let them do whatever they wish.
Phronsie belongs to them too, Alexia, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>“Yes, I know,” said Alexia.</p>

<p>“Polly!” called Jasper, over the stairs.</p>

<p>So Polly threw down the muslin cloud, and ran
to meet him.</p>

<p>“Here’s Mr. Tisbett wants to say something,”
said Jasper with a smile. “Now, then,” to the
stage-driver, “say just what is on your mind, Mr.
Tisbett.”</p>

<p>“I want to know,” began Mr. Tisbett, shuffling
uneasily from one foot to the other, “’hem—if
you’ll let me drive Miss Phronsie an’ her husband
home here from the deepo?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” began Polly.</p>

<p>“In the stage, ye know,” said Mr. Tisbett.
“If ye could now let me, I’d be ’bleeged to ye.
Seems if ’twould set me up fer th’ rest o’ my life.
I want to do somethin’ fer that blessed child I’ve
seen grow up from a baby;” and he covered his
face with his big hand.</p>

<p>“And so you shall!” cried Polly, seizing his
other horny palm, and ashamed of herself for the
dismay that swept over her at this plan, that
would deprive Jasper and her from driving Phronsie
and Roslyn up to “The Oaks.” “Indeed, it
is lovely of you, Mr. Tisbett, to think of it;”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
which thrilled the honest stage-driver with delight
to his finger-tips.</p>

<p>“An’ I want to hev the priv’lege to drive yer
par up too,” said Mr. Tisbett, turning to Jasper a
face covered with confusion. “Land, but when I
think how I shook him up that fust time he ever
come here,—an’ I can’t never forget it,—I want
to do somethin’ fer him too.”</p>

<p>“Father forgot all about that a long time ago,
Mr. Tisbett,” said Jasper simply, “and so must
you.”</p>

<p>“Land, but you can fergit a thing teetotally
when you’re the one it’s done to,” said Mr. Tisbett,
scratching his head awkwardly. “Well, if he’ll
only fergive me enough to let me drive him up too,
I’ll be mortally obleeged.” He peered anxiously
into Jasper’s face.</p>

<p>“I can answer for father,” cried Jasper heartily;
“that he’ll be glad to have you drive him up here,
and it’s very kind of you to think of it;” and he
shook the honest stage-driver’s hand so cordially
that Mr. Tisbett shambled off delightedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe18_75" id="illus_p421">

<p class="caption">“‘An’ I want to hev the priv’lege to drive yer par up too,’ said

</figure>

<p>And the old church where Phronsie had gone
since babyhood, and Mr. Henderson had preached
so long, was to peal its new chimes for the first
time when she came back to Badgertown again.
This the people had begged. The meeting-house
was still standing it is true; but it had been
Mr. King’s work, when he gave up his old home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>
to be with Polly and Jasper, to make it just such
a church as Badgertown had longed for.</p>

<p>Oh, and Grandma Bascom was to be brought
over in a chair, and have the seat of honor on the
lawn: for this was to be an out-of-door <i>fête</i> for
Phronsie, when the day after the arrival the
wedding-party at “The Oaks” would take place,
to which all Badgertown was invited, in addition
to the hosts and hosts of other friends.</p>

<p>And the Beebes and Mr. and Mrs. Babbidge
and the “Scrannage girls,” all had very especial
invitations; Miss Sally composing a neat little
piece that would tell Mr. King how thankful they
were for the old home saved to them, and that
would supplement nicely Miss Belinda’s stiff note,
written after the first shock of finding the check
was over. For the old Scrannage pride had somehow
melted away, in a fashion that probably
would have surprised the old squire, who had
not much else to hand down to them but his
crotchety disposition and the mortgage. And
Bella Drysdale was invited to stay a few days
with Grace, who was in the seventh heaven of
delight that Phronsie Pepper was now really
her cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>And dear Mrs. Beebe had a pretty new cap that
had a great deal of pink ribbon about it, that
Phronsie had bought abroad for her, and sent
home by Polly. Barby and Elyot begged so hard
to carry the box containing it down to the little
shoe-shop, that they were bundled into the pony-cart
one fine morning, and Johnson took them
down, each holding fast to the box between them.
And old Mr. Beebe protested, at the trying on
that began at once, that he never had seen a cap
in all his life that was so beautiful nor so becoming—oh!
and the shops in the village were all to
be closed on the day of the <i>fête</i>, so that everybody,
old as well as young, could be at “The Oaks.”
And the long supper-tables were to be set on the
upper lawn, and the lower as well, where the terraces
ended; and the little brown house, filled like
a very bower of flowers, would be open from morning
till night to guests—for was not this to be
Phronsie’s own dear, sweet home?</p>

<p>Oh! and the ground was broken a little distance
off in the beautiful old meadow, where the
“Five Little Peppers” used to play when any
moments in their busy childhood allowed; and
there, near the old apple-tree, was to be laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>
the corner-stone—a beautiful block of marble
from Roslyn’s Roman studio—of the new studio
that was to rise very soon. And this was to be
put in place on the <i>fête</i> day.</p>

<p>Was there anything that was beautiful and
bright and joyful that was not to be crowded
into that blessed day?</p>

<p>And Johnny Fargo, his burns all well, after
many repentant talks cuddled up in Polly’s lap,
was comforted. And one day he tugged in a poor,
lean cat, found nobody knew where. “She’ll
like it,” he said stoutly, “when she comes home;
and I shall give it to her.”</p>

<p>And every farmhouse dotted here and there
around the hill that overtopped Badgertown
Centre had letters from city folk for the next
two weeks, to know if they would take boarders
about that time, and there wasn’t a farmer’s
wife who said “No.” And the hotel in Hingham
had all it could do to get ready for the
friends who were going there. And the steamer
was hurrying over the sea, that was bringing
Phronsie and her husband, Grandpapa, Mamsie,
little Doctor Fisher, Charlotte Chatterton, and
Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>At last the day arrived, one of September’s
most golden ones, when Mr. Marlowe telegraphed,
“Steamer in. Take the 12.10 train for Badgertown.”
And all the good old town, in waiting
for this same beautiful message, hurried to
the little station, at the signal from the church
chimes.</p>

<p>The schoolma’am down at the little schoolhouse
on the road to Spot Pond dismissed her
scholars instantly on the first note, and tied on
her bonnet, locked her door, and put the key
in her pocket, to hurry off with the rest.</p>

<p>Over the roads to the little station they came
by twos and threes, and in wagons and carryalls,
and everything that could be drawn by a horse.
And down around the hill wound an ox-team
or two; and every child held a little nosegay—and
then there were the flower maidens, gay
with their baskets of blooms. Oh, old Badgertown
was in its gala dress! While as for the
small station, when they arrived it looked like
a flower-garden indeed!</p>

<p>“How can we ever wait, Jasper?” cried Polly,
the color flying in and out of her cheeks, as they
found their way out, from among the groups of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
waiting people, to the end of the platform; “isn’t
it almost time they should be here?”</p>

<p>“Almost,” said Jasper with shining eyes, and
looking at his watch for the fiftieth time; “only
ten more minutes, Polly, and the train will be
due.”</p>

<p>“Ten horrible minutes!” cried Polly, wrinkling
her brows. “O Jasper! keep me off here, or I
shall disgrace myself before Barby and Elyot.
They are so patient,” with a glance in their
direction.</p>

<p>“Good reason why,” said Jasper with a laugh;
“they’ve all those flower-girls and nosegay children
to supervise. See! they are in the very
thickest of the crowd, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Well, they must come with us,” said Polly in
a tremor, “or they’ll lose the first sight. Oh, do
bring them, Jasper!”</p>

<p>“And Johnny and King,” cried Jasper, flying
off. “Here, you children, the whole bunch of
you, this way!”</p>

<p>But Barby and Elyot, deep in the charms of
the Badgertown children, were so excited that
they did not hear. “I’ll get ’em,” said Johnny
running up; and immediately he dashed off and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>
flushed and triumphant, brought the two little
Kings.</p>

<p>“Children,” said Polly with a happy ring in
her voice, “you’ll lose seeing Aunt Phronsie and
Uncle Roslyn come in if you do not stand close
by papa and me. Thank you, Johnny,” with a
bright smile to him “for telling them.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll get King now,” cried Johnny, his
little heart bumping with pleasure that he had
helped Mrs. King. “Hooray, here, King!” and
he flashed off at a sight of him in one of the
groups, while Barby and Elyot, aghast at what
they might have missed, clung close to Polly’s
hand.</p>

<p>Just then up stepped the first selectman, and
touched his hat, “We’ve arranged a place for you,
Mr. King and Mrs. King and family,” he said,
“if you’ll come this way.” And he led off importantly
through the groups of townspeople, to
whom Polly nodded happily and Jasper raised
his hat, to the other end of the platform. And
there, on a staging a little higher than the platform,
and trimmed about with evergreens and
flowers, was a little waiting-place reserved for
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>“Oh, how perfectly lovely, Mr. Bunce,” cried
Polly, “for you to do all this for us!”</p>

<p>“It is so good of you,” said Jasper heartily.</p>

<p>“Ye can see the train come in around the
curve,” said Mr. Bunce straightening up, with conscious
pride in every feature of his face. “And
the conductor’s goin’ to stop it right at this pint.
Glad you like it all, Mr. King,” he said; “th’
s’lectmen’ll be pleased.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, how could we help it!” cried Jasper
with feeling. “We shall never forget all that
you have done this day, Mr. Bunce.”</p>

<p>“When’ll the train come!” begged Barby, pulling
the first selectman by the arm; “say, when
will it? I want it very much, I do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll see her a-comin’ around that curve
pretty soon,” said Mr. Bunce, taking her soft little
palm in his stubby one. “Look sharp, now!”</p>

<p>So Barby stood on tiptoe, and Elyot and the
other boys did the same.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you a chair to stand on,” said Mr.
Bunce, hurrying into the station to bring one out;
then he put Barby on it. “And now I’ll get Rev.
Mr. Pepper and Mr. David, for you want to be
all together;” and he shambled off, Elyot and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>
King and Johnny swarming upon the chair to
look over Barby’s fat little shoulders.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it will ever come,” began
Barby, as Joel rushed up and swung her to his
broad shoulder with Elyot on the other, and David
hoisted King. Johnny stuck to the chair, when—“Here
it comes! <i>Here it comes!</i>” and all
the white handkerchiefs came fluttering out, as the
country folk hurried up; the children with the
flower-baskets, drawn up in two lines, gathered
their hands full of pretty blossoms; the old stage,
decked with garlands and festoons, with Mr. Tisbett
resplendent in his Sunday clothes on the
box, drove up around a waiting corner with a
flourish, to the platform front. And there was
Phronsie and Roslyn! and old Mr. King, his
handsome white head bared to the sun, was bowing
to right and to left, while Mamsie and little
Doctor Fisher, with Ben and Charlotte Chatterton
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>And then arose a mighty cheer from the throats
of the village people! And the flowers were
strewn, and the little nosegays were thrown, and
the whole bunch of Peppers, big and little, passed
up through the blossom-covered path. And Phronsie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span>
was helped into the old flower-decked stage
right gallantly by Grandpapa, who turned, and
bowed low to the Badgertown people. “I thank
you, my dear friends,” he said, “for this tribute
to the one whom we all love.” And then Jasper
said something to him in a low voice. “And
thank you, Mr. Tisbett,” said old Mr. King, his
hat still in his hand, and he put up his other
palm to grasp that of the stage-driver’s, “for asking
me to drive up too.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tisbett thought he should fall off from the
driver’s box with pride and delight after that.</p>

<p>And then away—Phronsie smiling into the
faces of the village people, and Roslyn, tall and
handsome beside her, bowing his thanks for this
tribute to her. Was there ever such a home-coming
before?</p>

<p>“Now, if it won’t rain,” gasped Alexia, on the
edge of it all, “to-morrow, O Pickering!” as they
ran for their dog-cart, and drove off to “The
Oaks,” by a short cut.</p>

<p>“Never you fear, Alexia,” said Pickering; “and
if it does, nothing can spoil this Badgertown welcome.
It was the finest thing possible.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” said Alexia; “but ‘The Oaks’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>
<i>fête</i> to-morrow—that will be <i>absolutely</i> perfect.
Do hurry, Pickering; we must get there to see
them drive up.”</p>

<p>And it not only did <i>not</i> rain on the morrow,
but was another golden day for Phronsie. The
arches were all up on the lawns at an early hour,
and so was the marriage-bell of white orchids;
while the Dunraven children were in readiness
to march, to be followed by Susan’s “Welcome-Home”
song. The rose-trimmed tables couldn’t
take on another blossom; while as for the little
brown house—well, it was a bower of roses, from
the old front door clear through to the “Provision
Room.”</p>

<p>And Phronsie, in her soft white gown trimmed
with white orchids, and her tall young husband,
destined to be so soon famous, moved around with
old Mr. King to all the groups, welcoming and
making happy every one—for it was to be an
all-day <i>fête</i>, with music and games for the little
ones, and flowers, collation, supper, and wedding-cake
for everybody.</p>

<p>And Jasper was toast-master when everybody
was seated at the long rose-trimmed tables, and
right royally did he manage that ceremony. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>
Mr. Bunce, the first selectman, responded for the
town of Badgertown, covering himself with glory;
and Grandpapa responded for Phronsie right gallantly.
And then she rose in her place by her
husband, in the centre of the table, and Roslyn
stood by her side. “I thank you all very much,”
said Phronsie in a clear voice, “for all you have
done for us. We shall never forget it. And we
love you very much indeed, and we are glad to
make our home here with you in dear old Badgertown.”</p>

<p>And then everybody got out of their chairs,
and waved their handkerchiefs,—a white, fluttering
cloud,—and tears of joy were on many
cheeks; and then Roslyn May was called on for
a speech, and a splendid one it was too, that
all the village folk cheered mightily. And Mr.
Mason Whitney and Mr. Marlowe spoke, and
Ben and David, and there were many calls for
Joel. And Pickering Dodge had a word or two
to say; and Rev. Mr. Henderson, oh!—“it was a
goodly wedding-breakfast, and,” as Alexia said,
“just <i>absolutely</i> perfect.”</p>

<p class="caption">“The little children from the Dunraven Home marched around Phronsie

</figure>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear, dear!” she gasped to Mrs. Fargo,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>after the feast was over, “it seems as if I couldn’t
bear any more bliss. But do look at Charlotte
Chatterton and Ben. Now will you tell me there
is nothing in it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say there was nothing in it,” said
Mrs. Fargo with a keen glance at the two.</p>

<p>“But you were cool as an oyster when I tried
to tell you about it long ago,” retorted Alexia.
“Oh, dear me!—well, we mustn’t stand here talking;
they are going to dedicate the studio now,
and lay the corner-stone.”</p>

<p>And when this was over, and the block of
marble from Roslyn’s studio from across the sea
was laid in place on the old Badgertown meadow,
to be made famous over two continents, then, at
a signal from Rev. Mr. Henderson, the little children
from the Dunraven Home marched around
Phronsie and her husband, each giving her a
white rose as they passed. And Susan sent all
her young heart into her “Welcome-Home” song;
and everybody applauded her, but she saw only
Phronsie’s smile.</p>

<p>“Whoever would have thought that little black
creature, that terrorized us all so that Christmas
Day at Dunraven, would turn out such a beautiful
singer?” said David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>“A good many things turn out differently from
what we expect,” said Mamsie with a smile, “and
that’s the best of it.”</p>

<p>Joel looked into Amy Loughead’s blue eyes,
“Yes, that’s the best of it,” he said.</p>

<p>Well, the best of all this beautiful <i>fête</i> was
yet to come. It was at sundown, when some
of the people, those who had far to drive, were
beginning to talk of going home, and were gathering
up their little children and saying “good-by.”
Jasper called “Attention!” and announced that
his brother, Mr. Roslyn May, had something to
say to them all. So they turned back where he
stood with Phronsie by his side in the centre of
the lawn; and when the large circle was formed,
and all was quite still, he said in a strong, clear
voice,—</p>

<p>“My wife wishes me to tell you that she
desires to mark this beautiful day by a gift to
the people of Badgertown, to show her love for
you all. She has therefore asked her brother Jasper
to buy for her the Peters homestead, and all
the land belonging to it, and to keep this purchase
a secret until to-day. Added to this, she presents
to the town this check,” he held it aloft,—those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span>
who were nearest could see that there were
several figures upon its face,—“that a free library
may be built and maintained, imposing only one
condition, and that is, that the name of the
library shall be the ‘Horatio King Library of
Badgertown.’ Mr. Bunce, as first selectman, will
you take charge of this bit of paper?”</p>

<p>Didn’t the people cheer then! The echo of
it seemed to reach to Badgertown’s very centre.
And some one ran down and set the church-bell
to ringing again, a merry peal. And with those
joyful notes in their ears, the country folk drove
home to their farmhouses, casting many a backward
glance at the “Five Little Peppers,” and
the little brown house, over which the golden
gleams of the setting sun were falling.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
